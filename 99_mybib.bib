We investigate the feasibility of using additive manufacturing processes based on digital mask projection in the fabrication of such digital materials. A multi-material maskimage- projection-based Stereolithography process has been developed. The related challenges on the development of such a process are identified. Our approaches to address such challenges are presented. A testbed has been developed to fabricate component with designed digital materials. Experimental results illustrate desired material properties can be achieved based on the developed process. Several multimaterial designs have been produced to highlight the capability of this promising technology for fabricating three-dimensional, multi-material objects with spatial control over placement of both material and structure.

abstract = {High fidelity reproductions of paintings provide new opportunitiesto museumsin preserving and providing access to cultural heritage. This article presents an integrated system that is able to capture and fabricate color, topography and gloss of a painting, of which gloss capturing forms the most important contribution. A 3D imaging system, utilizing stereo imaging combined with fringe projection, is extended to capture spatially varying gloss, based on the effect of specular reflectance polarization. The gloss is measured by sampling the specular reflection around Brewster's angle, where these reflections are effectively polarized and can be separated from the unpolarized, diffuse reflectance. Off-center gloss measurements are calibrated relative to the center measurement. Off-specular gloss measurements, following from local variation of the surface normal, are masked based on the height map and corrected. Shadowed regions, caused by the 3D relief, are treated similarly. The area of a single capture is approximately 180 × 90 mm at a resolution of 25 × 25 $\mu$m. Aligned color, height, and gloss tiles are stitched together off-line, registering overlapping color regions. The resulting color, height, and gloss maps are inputs for the poly-jet 3D printer. Two paintings were reproduced to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system. One painting was scanned four times, consecutively rotated by 90 degrees, to evaluate the influence of the scanning system geometric configuration on the gloss measurement. Experimental results show that the method is suficiently fast for practical application, i.e., to scan a whole painting within eight hours, during closing hours of a museum. The results can well be used for the purpose of physical reproduction and other applications needing first-order estimates of the appearance (e.g., conservation diagnostics and condition reports). Our method to extend appearance scanning with gloss measurements is a valuable addition in the quest for realistic reproductions, in terms of its practical applicability - number of images needed for reconstruction and speed - and its perceptual added value, when added to color and topography reproduction.},

abstract = {The apparent strength of adhesion has been measured for a soft elastic layer adhering to model porous substrates, consisting of rigid plates containing regular arrays of cylindrical holes. Two contributions to the apparent strength have been identified and compared with the predictions of a simple theoretical treatment. The first is adhesion to the surface itself. Because “rough” surfaces have greater area for bonding, the strength of adhesion was increased by as much as twenty-fold. The second arises from the work of breaking deeply embedded or entangled strands in order to detach the overlayer. Contributions from this mechanism were as much as several hundred times the (low) intrinsic strength of adhesion. Satisfactory agreement was obtained with theory in both cases. Measurements were also made using cloth substrates, when the adhering layer penetrated the cloth completely. The work of detaching and breaking permeating strands was again much larger than the intrinsic strength of adhesion, in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. {\textcopyright} 1990, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

Data acquisition techniques from computer vision, such as stereo range images and space carving, produce 3D point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners. Traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to vision-based data sets. Our method constructs a 3D implicit surface, formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions. We achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms: 1) the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data, 2) the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate, rather than exactly interpolate, the data, and 3) the reconstructed surface is locally detailed, yet globally smooth, because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness.},

abstract = {Four-dimensional (4D) printing, a new technology emerged from additive manufacturing (3D printing), is widely known for its capability of programming post-fabrication shape-changing into artifacts. Fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 4D printing, in particular, uses thermoplastics to produce artifacts and requires computational analysis to assist the design processes of complex geometries. However, these artifacts are weak against structural loads, and the design quality can be limited by less accurate material models and numerical simulations. To address these issues, this paper propounds a composite structure design made of two materials – polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber reinforced PLA (CFPLA) – to increase the structural strength of 4D printed artifacts and a workflow composed of several physical experiments and series of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to characterize materials. We apply this workflow to 3D printed samples fabricated with different printed parameters to accurately characterize the materials and implement a sequential finite element analysis (FEA) to achieve accurate simulations. The accuracy of deformation induced by the triggering process is both computationally and experimentally verified with several creative design examples and is measured to be at least 95{\%}, with a confidence interval of (0.972,0.985). We believe the presented workflow is essential to the combination of geometry, material mechanism and design, and has various potential applications.},

abstract = {To print a 3D model with a 3D SLA printer, support structures are required for areas such as overhangs and islands. If there is no support structure below islands, the solidified material will float around in the vat. Further deposition in the areas will sink as well, resulting in a printing failure. This issue is called the floating island problem. To resolve this problem, two different approaches to detect support points have been developed. One is a slice-based approach that pre-slices the given 3D model and compares all sets of two consecutive layers; this is computationally inefficient. The other is a mesh-based approach that investigates primitives such as points, edges, and faces and samples the clusters; this method, however, tends to miss the local minimums and causes the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method to create support structures. This method does not lead to the floating island problem, in contrast to the mesh-based approach. Besides, this method does not need pre-slice 3D models, nor does it need to compare slices. It first converts a 3D model into a geometric representation called a layered depth image (LDI). It then creates a directed graph from the LDI to describe the delivery path of self-support and identifies efficient support points to prevent material waste. The structures can be reinforced by considering the volume as well as the geometry of the model. They are also reinforced by adding connections between anchors to increase stability. This method is compared to well-known commercial slicers. The result proves that this method is computationally efficient and never causes floating island problems.},

abstract = {Functionally graded conformal lattice structures (FGCLSs) are a particular type of lattice structure in which lattice unit cells are populated following structural boundaries and the density of the lattice unit cells is optimally distributed. Additionally, additively manufactured parts are reported to have anisotropic mechanical properties that highly depend on the part build orientations. This is extremely important in designing FGCLS parts where orientations of lattice unit cells are not uniform, making the build orientation selection more challenging. In this study, a concurrent density distribution and build orientation optimization framework of additively manufactured FGCLSs for structure-performance maximization was developed. The proposed approach was validated via case studies on lightweight part design for compliance minimization, with three design examples having geometric complexity levels varying from low to high. The results showed that the proposed concurrent optimization method was more effective at enhancing structural performance than optimizing only the density distribution of the structure. In addition, the build orientation configurations determined by the proposed method provided better structural performance compared to those determined using other slicing software. Moreover, compared to the pseudo-worst build orientation configuration, the configuration obtained from the proposed approach could enhance structural performance by up to 47.56{\%}.},

abstract = {Many biological systems possess hierarchical and fractal-like interfaces and joint structures that bear and transmit loads, absorb energy, and accommodate growth, respiration, and/or locomotion. In this paper, an elastic deterministic fractal composite mechanical model was formulated to quantitatively investigate the role of structural hierarchy on the stiffness, strength, and failure of suture joints. From this model, it was revealed that the number of hierarchies (N) can be used to tailor and to amplify mechanical properties nonlinearly and with high sensitivity over a wide range of values (orders of magnitude) for a given volume and weight. Additionally, increasing hierarchy was found to result in mechanical interlocking of higher-order teeth, which creates additional load resistance capability, thereby preventing catastrophic failure in major teeth and providing flaw tolerance. Hence, this paper shows that the diversity of hierarchical and fractal-like interfaces and joints found in nature have definitive functional consequences and is an effective geometric-structural strategy to achieve different properties with limited material options in nature when other structural geometries and parameters are biologically challenging or inaccessible. This paper also indicates the use of hierarchy as a design strategy to increase design space and provides predictive capabilities to guide the mechanical design of synthetic flaw-tolerant bioinspired interfaces and joints. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

The application of this suture interface model is exemplified for the case of the general trapezoidal wave-form. Expressions for the in-plane stiffness, strength and fracture toughness and failure mechanisms are derived as nonlinear functions of shape factor $\beta$ (which characterizes the general trapezoidal shape as triangular, trapezoidal, rectangular or anti-trapezoidal), the wavelength/amplitude ratio, the interface width/wavelength ratio, and the stiffness and strength ratios of the skeletal/interfacial phases. These results provide guidelines for choosing and tailoring interface geometry to optimize the mechanical performance in resisting different loads.

abstract = {Geometrically structured interfaces in nature possess enhanced, and often surprising, mechanical properties, and provide inspiration for materials design. This paper investigates the mechanics of deformation and failure mechanisms of suture interface designs through analytical models and experiments on 3D printed polymer physical prototypes. Suture waveforms with generalized trapezoidal geometries (trapezoidal, rectangular, anti-trapezoidal, and triangular) are studied and characterized by several important geometric parameters: the presence or absence of a bonded tip region, the tip angle, and the geometry. It is shown that a wide range (in some cases as great as an order of magnitude) in stiffness, strength, and toughness is achievable dependent on tip bonding, tip angle, and geometry. Suture interfaces with a bonded tip region exhibit a higher initial stiffness due to the greater load bearing by the skeletal teeth, a double peak in the stress-strain curve corresponding to the failure of the bonded tip and the failure of the slanted interface region or tooth, respectively, and an additional failure and toughening mechanism due to the failure of the bonded tip. Anti-trapezoidal geometries promote the greatest amplification of properties for suture interfaces with a bonded tip due the large tip interface area. The tip angle and geometry govern the stress distributions in the teeth and the ratio of normal to shear stresses in the interfacial layers, which together determine the failure mechanism of the interface and/or the teeth. Rectangular suture interfaces fail by simple shearing of the interfaces. Trapezoidal and triangular suture interfaces fail by a combination of shear and tensile normal stresses in the interface, leading to plastic deformation, cavitation events, and subsequent stretching of interface ligaments with mostly elastic deformation in the teeth. Anti-trapezoidal suture interfaces with small tip angles have high stress concentrations in the teeth and fail catastrophically by tooth failure, whereas larger tip angles exhibit a shear failure of the interfaces. Therefore, larger tip angles and trapezoidal or triangular geometries promote graceful failure, and smaller tip angles and anti-trapezoidal geometries promote more brittle-like failure. This dependence is reminiscent of biological systems, which exhibit a range of failure behaviors with limited materials and varied geometry. Triangular geometries uniquely exhibit uniform stress distributions in its teeth and promote the greatest amplification of mechanical properties. In both the bonded and unbonded cases, the predictions from the presented analytical models and experimental results on 3D printed prototypes show excellent agreement. This validates the analytical models and allows for the models to be used as a tool for the design of new materials and interfaces with tailored mechanical behavior.},

abstract = {Hierarchical interlocking leads to optimal mechanical properties for sutures in nature. Inspired by this, a design method for describing a hierarchal triangular suture joint based on Koch fractal interlocking is developed. The effect of geometrical interlocking was examined by the analysis of the load transmission between joined parts. Samples of hierarchal suture joints were fabricated by using a high-resolution 3D printer and tensile tests were conducted to examine the mechanical behavior of these joints. The surface displacement and strain fields were obtained using the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technology where the images were taken by a high-resolution microscope camera. Finite element models of the hierarchal suture joints were generated to simulate the tensile responses and to predict the stress distributions and failure modes. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental data. The results of this study show that the second order suture joint with a sinusoidal center line exhibits not only high strength but also high ductility. Moreover, by increasing the hierarchical order from two to three, the stiffness and strength do not improve while the fracture toughness actually decreases, suggesting that increasing the fractal complexity does not always lead to the improvement of the structure's load-carrying capacity, even with low iterations for the fractal complexity. The results obtained in this study can serve as a guideline to the engineering design of suture joints with fractal interlocks.},

abstract = {Open-cell structures such as self-interlocking (SIL) assemblies show advantages in weight reduction, insulation, energy dissipation, and impact energy absorption. However, there are few studies investigating the tensile property and energy absorption performance of SIL structures. Here, topological SIL polymeric structures were 3D printed by fused deposition modeling with constant and proportional strut thickness, to study the scaling laws relating strength and toughness of the structure to its dimensions. Relative density $\rho$‾ changes from 0.03 to 0.31 with the number of tetrahedron elements in X/Y directions for structures which have constant strut thickness; but the $\rho$‾ is fixed at 0.13 regarding the number of tetrahedron elements changes for those with proportional strut thickness. According to tensile and in-plane/out-of-plane compression tests, as well as FEA analysis, there is a clear relative density dependence in the defect-tolerant structure performance. The maximum tensile stresses for samples C-77 ($\rho$‾ = 0.31) and P-77 ($\rho$‾ = 0.13) are 4.68 MPa and 1.15 MPa, respectively. And the absorbed kinetic energy is about 2.7 J/cm3 for sample C-77 but 0.6 J/cm3 for sample P-77. It is envisioned that such structure can be reinforced within a host for impact mitigation and damage-induced crack on-demand healing for future endeavors.},

abstract = {Structural biological materials such as bone, teeth or mollusk shells draw their remarkable performance from a sophisticated interplay of architectures and weak interfaces. Pushed to the extreme, this concept leads to sutured materials, which contain thin lines with complex geometries. Sutured materials are prominent in nature, and have recently served as bioinspiration for toughened ceramics and glasses. Sutures can generate large deformations, toughness and damping in otherwise all brittle systems and materials. In this study we examine the design and optimization of sutures with a jigsaw puzzle-like geometry, focusing on the non-linear traction behavior generated by the frictional pullout of the jigsaw tabs. We present analytical models which accurately predict the entire pullout response. Pullout strength and energy absorption increase with higher interlocking angles and for higher coefficients of friction, but the associated high stresses in the solid may fracture the tabs. Systematic optimization reveals a counter-intuitive result: the best pullout performance is achieved with interfaces with low coefficient of friction and high interlocking angle. We finally use 3D printing and mechanical testing to verify the accuracy of the models and of the optimization. The models and guidelines we present here can be extended to other types of geometries and sutured materials subjected to other loading/boundary conditions. The nonlinear responses of sutures are particularly attractive to augment the properties and functionalities of inherently brittle materials such as ceramics and glasses.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing strives to combine any combination of materials into 3D functional structures and devices, ultimately opening up the possibility of 3D printed machines. It remains difficult to actuate such devices, thus limiting the scope of 3D printed machines to passive devices or necessitating the incorporation of external actuators that are manufactured differently. Here, 3D printed hybrid thermoplast/conducter bilayers are explored, which can be actuated by differential heating caused by externally controllable currents flowing through their conducting faces. The functionality of such actuators is uncovered and it is shown that they allow to 3D print, in one pass, simple flexible robotic structures that propel forward under step-wise applied voltages. Moreover, exploiting the thermoplasticity of the nonconducting plastic parts at elevated temperatures, it is shown that how strong driving leads to irreversible deformations—a form of 4D printing—which also enlarges the range of linear response of the actuators. Finally, it is shown that how to leverage such thermoplastic relaxations to accumulate plastic deformations and obtain very large deformations by alternatively driving both layers of a bilayer; this is called ratcheting. The strategy is scalable and widely applicable, and opens up a new approach to reversible actuation and irreversible 4D printing of arbitrary structures and machines.},

abstract = {Silicones have desirable properties such as skin-safety, high temperature-resistance, and flexibility. Many applications require the presence of a hard body connected to the silicone. Traditionally, it has been difficult to create strong bonding between silicones and hard materials. In this study, a technique is presented to control the bonding strength between silicones and thermoplastics through mechanical interlocking. This is realized through a hybrid fabrication method where silicone is cast onto a 3D-printed mold and interlocking structure. The influence of the structure's design parameters on the bonding strength is explored through theoretical modeling and physical testing, while the manufacturability of the 3D-printed structure is ensured. A CAD tool is developed to automatically apply the interlocking structure to product surfaces. The user interface visualizes the theoretical strength of the cells as the designer adjusts the cell parameters, allowing the designer to iteratively optimize the structure to the product's load case. The bonding strength of the presented mechanical interlocking structure is more than 5.5 times higher than can be achieved with a commercially available primer. The presented technique enables custom digital design and manufacturing of durable free-form parts. This is demonstrated through application of the technique in over-molded products, airtight seals, and soft pneumatic actuators.},

abstract = {Conventional 3D printing approaches are restricted to building up material in a layer-by-layer format, which is more appropriately considered “2.5-D” printing. The layered structure inherently results in significant mechanical anisotropy in printed parts, causing the tensile strength in the build direction (z-axis) to be only a fraction of the in-plane strength – a decrease of 50–75{\%} is common. In this study, a novel “z-pinning” approach is described that allows continuous material to be deposited across multiple layers within the volume of the part. The z-pinning process is demonstrated using a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) printer for polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber reinforced PLA. For both materials, z-pinning increased the tensile strength and toughness in the z-direction by more than a factor of 3.5. Direct comparisons to tensile strength in the x-axis showed a significant decrease in mechanical anisotropy as the volume of the pin was increased relative to the void in the rectilinear grid structure. In fact, the PLA sample with the largest pin volume demonstrated mechanically isotropic properties within the statistical uncertainty of the tests. Tensile test results were also analyzed relative to the functional area resisting deformation for each sample.},

Whereas scaffolds are expected to provide multifunctional performance, spatially changing pore patterns have been a promising approach to integrate mechanical characteristics of different architectures into a unique scaffold. Smooth morphological variations are also frequently seen in nature particularly in bone and cartilage structures and can be inspiring for designing of artificial tissues. In this study, we carried out experimental and numerical procedures to uncover the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of linearly graded porosity scaffolds for two different mathematically defined pore structures. Among TPMS-based scaffolds, P and D surfaces were subjected to gradient modeling to explore the mechanical responses for stretching and bending dominated deformations, respectively. Moreover, the results were compared to their corresponding uniform porosity structures. Mechanical properties were found to be by far greater for the stretching dominated structure (P-Surface). For bending dominated architecture (D-Surface), although there was no global fracture for uniform structures, graded structure showed a brittle fracture at 0.08 strain. A layer by layer deformation mechanism for stretching dominated structure was observed. For bending dominated scaffolds, deformation was accompanied by development of 45° shearing bands. Finite element simulations were also performed and the results showed a good agreement with the experimental observations.},

abstract = {Hard biological tissues (e.g., nacre and bone) have evolved for millions of years, enabling them to overcome the conflict between different mechanical properties. The key to their success lies in the combination of limited material ingredients (i.e., hard and soft constituents) and mechanistic ingredients (e.g., functional gradients and building block hierarchical organization). However, the contribution of each material and mechanistic ingredient is still unknown, hindering the development of efficient synthetic composites. Quantitative and systematic studies of hard–soft composites are required to unravel every factor's role in properties outcome. Herein, a voxel-by-voxel multi-material 3D printing technique is used to design and additively manufacture different groups of hard–soft composites. Several combinations of gradients, multilevel hierarchies, and brick-and-mortar arrangements are created. Single-edge notched fracture specimens are mechanically tested and computationally simulated using extended finite element method (XFEM). It is found that functional gradients alone are not sufficient to improve fracture properties. However, up to twice the fracture energy of the hard face is observed when combining functional gradients with hierarchical designs, significantly increasing composite properties. Microscopic analysis, digital image correlation, and strain distributions predicted with XFEM are used to discuss the mechanisms responsible for the observed behaviors.},

In this work, we explore the topology-property relationship of several classes of periodic cellular materials; the first class is strut-based structures, while the second and third classes are derived from the mathematically created triply periodic minimal surfaces, namely; the skeletal-TPMS and sheet-TPMS cellular structures. Powder bed fusion technology was employed to fabricate the cellular structures of various relative densities out of Maraging steel. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also employed to assess the quality of the printed parts. Compressive testing was performed to deduce the mechanical properties of the considered cellular structures. Results showed that the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures exhibited a near stretching-dominated deformation behavior, while skeletal-TPMS showed a bending-dominated behavior. On the other hand, the Kelvin and Gibson-Ashby strut-based topologies exhibited a mixed mode of deformation while the Octet-truss showed a stretching-dominated behavior. Overall the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures showed superior mechanical properties among all the tested structures. The most interesting observation is that sheet-based Diamond TPMS structure showed the best mechanical performance with nearly independence of relative density. It was also observed that at decreased volume fractions the effect of geometry on the mechanical properties is more pronounced.},

abstract = {It is often highly desirable to simultaneously optimize the layout of embedded functional components and the topology of the host structure supporting these components to achieve the best overall performance while still ensuring the structural integrity. We propose a topology optimization framework to account for connecting interface behaviors between the components and the host structure. Here we treat the connecting interfaces with the cohesive zone model to reflect the adhesively bonded interface behaviors. A conforming mesh in conjunction with interface elements is employed to discretize the evolving structure while accounting for the strong discontinuity of displacement field across the material interfaces. To give a clear representation of structural boundaries and the connecting interfaces, we also suggest a multi-material interpolation model in the level set framework, which can conveniently define the connecting interface locations and describe multi-material distribution without redundant phase in the design domain. The objective function is defined as the sum of the strain energy and the work done by the traction on the connecting interface, and the evolution velocities of the level set and the embedded components are treated as design variables. These design variables are updated with the MMA optimizer on the basis of adjoint-variable sensitivity analysis. This optimization formulation allows multiple constraints and mixed design variables (i.e level set design variables and components' design variables) to be easily handled in level set based optimization. The design is advanced by the Hamilton–Jacobi equation with the velocity design variables as input. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate a build process variation for fused deposition modeling (FDM) in which contours and rasters (also referred to as internal fill patterns) are built using different layer thicknesses and road widths. In particular, the paper examines the effect of the build process variation on surface roughness, production times and mechanical properties. Additionally, a unique FDM process was developed that enabled the deposition of discrete multiple materials at different layers and regions within layers. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-material, multi-technology FDM system was developed and constructed to enable the production of parts using either discrete multi-materials or the build process variation (variable layer thickness and road width). Two legacy FDM machines were modified and installed onto a single manufacturing system to allow the strategic, spatially controlled thermoplastic deposition with multiple extrusion nozzles of multiple materials during the same build. This automated process was enabled by the use of a build platform attached to a pneumatic slide that moved the platform between the two FDM systems, an overall control system, a central PC and a custom-made program (FDMotion) and graphic user interface. The term multi-technology FDM system used here implies the two FDM systems and the integration of these systems into a single manufacturing environment using the movable platform and associated hardware and software. Future work will integrate additional technologies within this system. Parts produced using the build process variation utilized internal roads with 1,524 $\mu$m road width and 508 $\mu$m layer height, while the contours used 254 $\mu$m road width and 127 $\mu$m layer height. Measurements were performed and compared to standard FDM parts that included surface roughness of planes at different inclinations, tensile testing and fabrication times. Findings: Results showed that when compared to the standard FDM process, the parts produced using the build process variation exhibited the same tensile properties as determined by a student's t-test (p-values {\textgreater} 0.05, $\mu$1-$\mu$2 = 0, n = 5). Surface roughness measurements revealed that the process variation resulted in surface roughness (Ra) improvements of 55, 43, 44 and 38 per cent for respective planes inclined at 10,15, 30 and 45° from vertical. In addition, for a 50.8 × 50.8 mm square section (25.4 mm tall), the build process variation required a minimum of 2.8 hours to build, while the standard FDM process required 6.0 hours constituting a 53 per cent reduction in build time. Finally, several manufacturing demonstrations were performed including the fabrication of a discrete PC-ABS sandwich structure containing tetragonal truss core elements. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates a build strategy that varies contour and raster widths and layer thicknesses for FDM that can be used to improve surface roughness - a characteristic that has historically been in need of improvement - and reduce fabrication time while retaining mechanical properties. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The apparent strength of adhesion has been measured for a soft elastic layer adhering to model porous substrates, consisting of rigid plates containing regular arrays of cylindrical holes. Two contributions to the apparent strength have been identified and compared with the predictions of a simple theoretical treatment. The first is adhesion to the surface itself. Because “rough” surfaces have greater area for bonding, the strength of adhesion was increased by as much as twenty-fold. The second arises from the work of breaking deeply embedded or entangled strands in order to detach the overlayer. Contributions from this mechanism were as much as several hundred times the (low) intrinsic strength of adhesion. Satisfactory agreement was obtained with theory in both cases. Measurements were also made using cloth substrates, when the adhering layer penetrated the cloth completely. The work of detaching and breaking permeating strands was again much larger than the intrinsic strength of adhesion, in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. {\textcopyright} 1990, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {Multi-axis additive manufacturing enables high flexibility of material deposition along dynamically varied directions. The Cartesian motion platforms of these machines include three parallel axes and two rotational axes. Singularity on rotational axes is a critical issue to be tackled in motion planning for ensuring high quality of manufacturing results. The highly nonlinear mapping in the singular region can convert a smooth toolpath with uniformly sampled waypoints defined in the model coordinate system into a highly discontinuous motion in the machine coordinate system, which leads to over-extrusion / under-extrusion of materials in filament-based additive manufacturing. Moreover, collision may occur when sampling-based collision avoidance is employed. In this paper, we present a motion planning method to support the manufacturing realization of designed toolpaths for multi-axis additive manufacturing. Problems of singularity and collision are considered in an integrated manner to improve the motion therefore the quality of fabrication. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method.},

abstract = {Common thermoplastic 3D Printed parts have reduced mechanical properties in the build direction of the print, and are generally weaker and less stiff than their equivalent injection-molded or machined parts. A promising solution to increase the stiffness and strength is investigating the addition of continuous carbon fibers in the print. Reinforcement of the inter-layer bonding may come through the addition of continuous fiber reinforced material deposited on an existing structure in the build direction, which implies stepping away from layer-by-layer manufacturing using true 3D deposition and toolpathing. This is possible by exploiting the full benefits of a 6 degree of freedom Fused Filament Fabricated/Fused Deposition Modeled system. For this research, an industrial robotic platform is equipped with a continuous fiber deposition end effector capable of deposition with engineering thermoplastics. Using previously developed application-driven software to generate the toolpaths for the printer, a variety of parts were printed. The parts range from traditional, horizontal layer-by-layer parts to multi-axis overprinted parts. During ASTM tensile testing of coupons, a sixfold tensile strength-to-weight increase and a sixteenfold increase in tensile stiffness are observed when compared to unreinforced thermoplastic properties. The potential of the system and software capabilities are further demonstrated though sample complex multi-axis 3D printed parts.},

That is a limitation considering the wide diffusion of dual extruders printers and the possibility of increasing the number of these extruders. An exploratory study, based on tensile tests and performed on double-material butt-joined bars, was thus conceived; the aim was to explore how the adhesion strength between 3 pairs of filaments (TPU-PLA, PLA-CPE, CPE-TPU) is influenced by the material printing order, the type of slicing pattern used for the layers at the interface, and the infill density of the layers below the interface. Results confirm the effectiveness of mechanical interlocking strategies in increasing the adhesion strength even when thermodynamic and diffusion mechanisms of adhesion are not robust enough. Besides, thermal aspects also demonstrated to play a relevant role in influencing the performance of the interface.},

To print fine structures, an appropriate choice of parameters is necessary, or printing error occurs. On the other hand, the printing error is exploited as an expression technique. However, the relation between the printed structure and the parameters causing the printing error is unclear. In this paper, we focus on the height position of the extruder and the amount of extruded material, and explore the combination of these parameters to enhance the capability of FDM. By extending an equation that calculates the amount of material from the layer height, we investigate the behavior and structure of material extruded from various height positions. On the basis of experimental results, the printed structure is classified into six categories according to the structural feature. We describe these structural features and demonstrate examples with new inherent expressions for FDM. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract = {Purpose: An issue when printing multi-material objects is understanding how different materials will perform together, especially because interfaces between them are always created. This paper aims to address this interface from a mechanical perspective and evaluates how it should be designed for a better mechanical performance. Design/methodology/approach: Different interface mechanisms were considered, namely, microscopic interfaces that are based on chemical bonding and were represented with a U-shape interface; a macroscopic interface characterized by a mechanical interlocking mechanism, represented by a T-shape interface; and a mesoscopic interface that sits between other interface systems and that was represented by a dovetail shape geometry. All these different interfaces were tested in two different material sets, namely, poly (lactic acid)–poly (lactic acid) and poly (lactic acid)–thermoplastic polyurethane material pairs. These two sets represent high- and low-compatibility materials sets, respectively. Findings: The results showed, despite the materials' compatibility level, multi-material objects will have a better mechanical performance through a macroscopic interface, as it is based on a mechanical interlocking system, of which performance cannot be achieved by a simple face-to-face interface even when considering the same material. Originality/value: The paper investigates the importance of interface design in multi-material 3D prints by fused filament fabrication. Especially, for parts intended to be subjected to mechanical efforts, simple face-to-face interfaces are not sufficient and more robust and macroscopic-based interface geometries (based on mechanical interlocking systems) are advised. Moreover, such interfaces do not raise esthetic problems because of their working principle; the 3D printing technology can hide the interface geometries, if required.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a sample-based approach for surface coloring, which is independent of the original surface resolution and representation. To achieve this, we introduce the Orthogonal Fragment Buffer (OFB)-an extension of the Layered Depth Cube-as a high-resolution view-independent surface representation. The OFB is a data structure that stores surface samples at a nearly uniform distribution over the surface, and it is specifically designed to support efficient random read/write access to these samples. The data access operations have a complexity that is logarithmic in the depth complexity of the surface. Thus, compared to data access operations in tree data structures like octrees, data-dependent memory access patterns are greatly reduced. Due to the particular sampling strategy that is employed to generate an OFB, it also maintains sample coherence, and thus, exhibits very good spatial access locality. Therefore, OFB-based surface coloring performs significantly faster than sample-based approaches using tree structures. In addition, since in an OFB, the surface samples are internally stored in uniform 2D grids, OFB-based surface coloring can efficiently be realized on the GPU to enable interactive coloring of high-resolution surfaces. On the OFB, we introduce novel algorithms for color painting using volumetric and surface-aligned brushes, and we present new approaches for particle-based color advection along surfaces in real time. Due to the intermediate surface representation we choose, our method can be used to color polygonal surfaces as well as any other type of surface that can be sampled. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {An improved HVAC system for portable classrooms was specified to address key problems in existing units. These included low energy efficiency, poor control of and provision for adequate ventilation, and excessive acoustic noise. Working with industry, a prototype improved heat pump air conditioner was developed to meet the specification. A one-year measurement- intensive field-test of ten of these IHPAC systems was conducted in occupied classrooms in two distinct California climates. These measurements are compared to those made in parallel in side by side portable classrooms equipped with standard 10 SEER heat pump air conditioner equipment. The IHPAC units were found to work as designed, providing predicted annual energy efficiency improvements of about 36{\%} to 42{\%} across California's climate zones, relative to 10 SEER units. Classroom ventilation was vastly improved as evidenced by far lower indoor minus outdoor CO2 concentrations. The IHPAC units were found to provide ventilation that meets both California State energy and occupational codes and the ASHRAE minimum ventilation requirements; the classrooms equipped with the 10 SEER equipment universally did not meet these targets. The IHPAC system provided a major improvement in indoor acoustic conditions. HVAC system generated background noise was reduced in fan-only and fan and compressor modes, reducing the nose levels to better than the design objective of 45 dB(A), and acceptable for additional design points by the Collaborative on High Performance Schools. The IHPAC provided superior ventilation, with indoor minus outdoor CO2 concentrations that showed that the Title 24 minimum ventilation requirement of 15 CFM per occupant was nearly always being met. The opposite was found in the classrooms utilizing the 10 SEER system, where the indoor minus outdoor CO2 concentrations frequently exceeded levels that reflect inadequate ventilation. Improved ventilation conditions in the IHPAC lead to effective removal of volatile organic compounds and aldehydes, on average lowering the concentrations by 57{\%} relative to the levels in the 10 SEER classrooms. The average IHPAC to 10 SEER formaldehyde ratio was about 67{\%}, indicating only a 33{\%} reduction of this compound in indoor air. The IHPAC thermal control system provided less variability in occupied classroom temperature than the 10 SEER thermostats. The average room temperatures in all seasons tended to be slightly lower in the IHPAC classrooms, often below the lower limit of the ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort band. State-wide and national energy modeling provided conservative estimates of potential energy savings by use of the IHPAC system that would provide payback a the range of time far lower than the lifetime of the equipment. Assuming electricity costs of {\$}0.15/kWh, the per- classroom range of savings is from about {\$}85 to {\$}195 per year in California, and about {\$}89 to {\$}250 per year in the U.S., depending upon the city. These models did not include the non-energy benefits to the classrooms including better air quality and acoustic conditions that could lead to improved health and learning in school. Market connection efforts that were part of the study give all indication that this has been a very successful project. The successes include the specification of the IHPAC equipment in the CHPS portable classroom standards, the release of a commercial product based on the standards that is now being installed in schools around the U.S., and the fact that a public utility company is currently considering the addition of the technology to its customer incentive program. These successes indicate that the IHPAC may reach its potential to improve ventilation and save energy in classrooms.},

abstract = {Lightweight cellular structure generation and topology optimization are common design methodologies in additive manufacturing. In this work, we present a novel optimization strategy for designing functionally graded cellular structures with desired mechanical properties. This approach is mainly by generating variable-density gyroid structure and then performing graded structure optimization. Firstly, the geometric properties of the original gyroid structures are analyzed, and the continuity and connectivity of the structures are optimized by adding a penalty function. Then, a homogenization method is used to obtain mechanical properties of gyroid-based cellular structures through a scaling law as a function of their relative densities. Secondly, the scaling law is added directly into the structure optimization algorithm to compute the optimal density distribution in part being optimized. Thirdly, the density mapping and interpolation approach are used to map the output of structure optimization into the parametric gyroid structure which results in an optimum lightweight lattice structure with uniformly varying densities across the design space. Lastly, the effectiveness and robustness of the optimized results are analyzed through finite element analysis and experiments.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing techniques form an object by accumulating layers of material on top of one another. Each layer has to be supported by the one below for the fabrication process to succeed. To reduce print time and material usage, especially in the context of prototyping, it is often desirable to fabricate hollow objects. This exacerbates the requirement of support between consecutive layers: standard hollowing produces surfaces in overhang that cannot be directly fabricated anymore. Therefore, these surfaces require internal support structures. These are similar to external supports for overhangs, with the key difference that internal supports remain invisible within the object after fabrication. A fundamental challenge is to generate structures that provide a dense support while using little material. In this paper, we propose a novel type of support inspired by rib structures. Our approach guarantees that any point in a layer is supported by a point below, within a given threshold distance. Despite providing strong guarantees for printability, our supports remain lightweight and reliable to print. We propose a greedy support generation algorithm that creates compact hierarchies of rib-like walls. The walls are progressively eroded away and straightened, eventually merging with the interior object walls. We demonstrate our technique on a variety of models and provide performance figures in the context of fused filament fabrication 3D printing.},

abstract = {Material extrusion is a popular process for both prototyping and digital manufacturing, yet it is lacking in terms of part strength, feature resolution, and production rate relative to alternative processes. Injection printing addresses these issues by combining material extrusion of the outer surfaces of the part at fine resolution with injection molding of larger interior cavities at high flow rates. Injection printing thus aims to utilize the full melting capacity of material extrusion printers to mitigate the curse of dimensionality that plagues additive manufacturing. Simple governing models for flow in the formed cavities as well as the stress and deflection of the shell walls are presented. To validate the performance of injection printing relative to material extrusion, impact specimens and tensile bars were printed of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The tensile and impact results of the samples were compared, and image analysis was performed on the post-test samples. It was found that injection printing increased print speeds by an average factor of 3.2 relative to conventional material extrusion using the same linear print velocities. With respect to properties, the stiffness, strength, and strain to failure of injection printed tensile bars (in-plane) were respectively increased by 21 {\%}, 47 {\%}, and 35 {\%} compared to material extrusion. Properties of impact specimen and vertically printed tensile bars also showed promising gains albeit with constraints related to the printer's melting capacity. Even still, injection printing is shown as a broadly applicable and readily accessible process for increasing part strength and production rate while enabling improved feature resolution without greatly extended print times.},

abstract = {Metallic additive manufacturing techniques, in particular the selective laser melting (SLM) process, are capable of fabricating strong, lightweight and complex metallic lattice structures. However, they still face certain process limitations such as geometrical constraints and in some cases the need for support structures. This study evaluates the manufacturability and performance of SLM produced periodic cellular lattice structures, which are designed by repeating a unit cell type called gyroid consisting of circular struts and a spherical core. The effect of unit cell size on the manufacturability, density and compression properties of the manufactured cellular lattice structures were investigated. Micro-computer tomography (CT) scan results reveal that the gyroid cellular lattice structures with various unit cell sizes ranging from 2 to 8 mm can be manufactured free of defects by the SLM process without the need of additional support structures. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs show that the lattice structures made by SLM have a good geometric agreement with the original computer-aided design (CAD) models, but many partially melted metal particles are bonded to strut surfaces. The struts within the gyroid cellular lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes have higher densities due to their shorter scan vector lengths in the SLM process. The yield strength and Young's modulus of the Gyroid cellular lattice structures increase with the decrease in the unit cell size due to the denser struts of the lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, the energy-absorption performance of lattice metamaterials with a heterogeneous spatial layout of different unit cell architectures was studied. Such multi-morphology lattices can harness the distinct mechanical properties of different unit cells while being composed out of a single base material. A rational design approach was developed to explore the design space of these lattices, inspiring a non-intuitive design which was evaluated alongside designs based on mixture rules. Fabrication was carried out using two different base materials: 316L stainless steel and Vero White photopolymer. Results show that multi-morphology lattices can be used to achieve higher specific energy absorption than homogeneous lattice metamaterials. Additionally, it is shown that a rational design approach can inspire multi-morphology lattices which exceed rule-of-mixtures expectations.},

In this study, functionally graded sheet (FGS) structures with primitive (P) and gyroid (G) minimal surfaces were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) using Ti-6Al-4V powder. The mechanical properties, deformation behavior, and energy absorption performance of uniform sheet (US) and FGS lattice structures were systematically investigated using compression tests and the finite element method (FEM). The FGS structures were found to eliminate abrupt shear failure and to exhibit the predictable layer-by-layer deformation accompanied by sub-layer collapse. The cumulative energy absorption per unit volume of FGS samples increased as a power of strain function throughout the compression process, while the US samples exhibited a linear relationship, thus resulting in an excellent energy absorption capability for FGS structures. The energy absorption of FGS samples was higher than for US samples by approximately 60{\%}. In addition, the results of FEM with the Johnson-Cook models demonstrated a high capability for predicting the deformation behaviors as well as mechanical properties (especially in terms of yield strength, compressive strength and energy absorption) of lattice structures. which can be used to provide guidance on selecting a lattice structure to meet multifunctional demands.},

abstract = {Gradual and localised changes in mechanical properties can be achieved by functionally graded cellular structures with the aim to improve structural performance. Gyroid belongs to a class of cellular structures that naturally inspired continuous non-self-intersecting surfaces with controllable mechanical properties. In this work, dynamic compression on functionally graded gyroid and sandwich composite panels constructed from functionally graded gyroid core and metallic facets are numerically investigated and compared to evaluate the dynamic behaviours when subjected to extreme loadings. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is employed to investigate the deformation behaviours of proposed structures considering the rate-dependent properties, elastoplastic response and nonlinear contact. The Johnson-Cook model is utilised to capture the rate-dependent dynamic responses of the gyroid panels. The numerical model is then validated with experimental results under quasi-static compression. Due to the symmetry, only a quarter of the gyroid panel is modelled using shell elements, which offers significantly reduction in computational cost. Parametric studies are conducted to demonstrate the influences of different functionally graded cores on the blast resistances of gyroid composite panels. Reaction forces and critical stress extracted from underneath protected structure are assessed. Fuctionally graded gyroid sandwich structures clearly demonstrate unique dynamic crushing responses, impact energy mitigation {\&} dissipation mechanisms, which leads to enhancement of the blast resistance.},

abstract = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), which have zero mean curvature and large surface areas, are discussed in this paper. Two TPMS structures, the Schwarz Primitive (P) and Gyroid, were designed with both uniform and graded density and fabricated using additive manufacturing (Stereolithography). The mechanical properties and energy absorption abilities of the printed TPMS samples were studied. The Schwarz P structure cracked layer by layer and exhibited obvious peak-valley stress feature during the compression test. The total absorbed energy to the densification point was 1.64 MJ/m3 and 2.47 MJ/m3 for the uniform and graded Schwarz P structures, respectively. There was little difference between the uniform and graded Gyroid samples, and only one structural crack appeared during the compression test. The total absorbed energy for the uniform and graded Gyroid structures was approximately 2.49 MJ/m3 and 2.51 MJ/m3, respectively. The results showed that the graded Schwarz P structure absorbed more energy during the compression tests, while energy absorbed in the graded Gyroid structure was close to the uniform Gyroid structure. Furthermore, the relationship between energy absorption and compressive stress was determined and the abnormal characteristics in Gyroid structures were deeply discussed.},

abstract = {Robotic multi-axis curved layer additive manufacturing has drawn more attention recently owing
to its unique ability of printing complex shapes while avoiding the stair-step effect and the usage
of support structure. However, as the robotic manipulator is an open serial structure and the
printing layer now is no longer planar but a free-form surface, the shape and pattern of a printing
path now have a huge impact on the mechanical behaviour of the printer – an arbitrarily planned
printing path could cause severe angular fluctuations of the joints of the robotic manipulator
which in turn would lead to poor printing quality and prolonged printing time. In this paper,
a potential field based algorithm is proposed for automatically generating a printing path for
printing an arbitrary free-form curved layer on a robotic multi-axis printer. By considering both the
printing efficiency and the joints' kinematics, the potential field identifies the local optimal feed
direction on the curved layer. Then, by employing the iso-cusp height expansion method,
a printing path is generated to best fit this potential field. Both computer simulations and physical
printing experiments are carried out to assess the proposed methodologies and the results give
a positive confirmation on their advantages.},

Finally, the structures are fabricated with thevariational and uniform pattern and are then compared to thetraditional pattern using compression testing.

Without changing the external shape, we show that using such meta-material can lead to a dramatic change in the kinematics of the robot. This highlights the importance of modeling. Therefore, to help the design and to control soft robots made of these meso-structured materials, we present a modeling method based on numerical homogenization and Finite Element Method (FEM) that captures the anisotropic deformations.

We demonstrate the change in kinematics when the robot is built with meso-structured materials and compare its behavior with modeling results.},

abstract = {Fabrication efficiency has long been a challenge for additive manufacturing. Standard toolpath generation processes usually give rise to a significant number of non-productive motions that undermine production efficiency and degrade part quality due to frequent acceleration and deceleration in wasted motions. In this paper, we introduce an optimized toolpath generation process that comprises of decomposition of sliced model and optimization of fabrication sequences to minimize non-productive toolpaths. Unlike standard toolpaths, optimized toolpaths carry out fabrication of multiple objects in a staggered sequence to maximize manufacturing efficiency. To tackle the problem of interference between a printhead and objects due to changes in the fabrication sequence of layered depositions, an algorithm that adaptively determines collision-free heights is developed. Additionally, sliced model decomposition considerably reduces the number of entities for optimization. The computational cost involved in toolpath optimization is independent of slicing interval; therefore, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed optimization approach are well maintained for small slicing intervals. Benchmarks are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed toolpath planning approach, and two physical experiments are carried out using fused deposition modeling (FDM) and direct metal deposition (DMD) technologies. Non-productive toolpaths are reduced remarkably, and the desired fabrication quality is achieved for both non-metal and metal structures.},

One of the remaining obstacles to wide-scale adoption is that the object to be printed must fit into the working volume of the 3D printer. We propose a framework, called Chopper, to decompose a large 3D object into smaller parts so that each part fits into the printing volume. These parts can then be assembled to form the original object. We formulate a number of desirable criteria for the partition, including assemblability, having few components, unobtrusiveness of the seams, and structural soundness. Chopper optimizes these criteria and generates a partition either automatically or with user guidance. Our prototype outputs the final decomposed parts with customized connectors on the interfaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Chopper on a variety of non-trivial real-world objects. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

@article{Karasik2019,
abstract = {Fused deposition modeling based 3D-printing is becoming increasingly popular due to it's low-cost and simple operation and maintenance. While it produces rugged prints made from a wide range of materials, it suffers from an inherent printing limitation where it cannot produce overhanging surfaces of non-trivial size. This limitation can be handled by constructing temporary support-structures, however this solution involves additional material costs, longer print time, and often a fair amount of labor in removing it. In this paper we present a new method for partitioning general solid objects into a small number of parts that can be printed with no support. The partitioning is computed by applying a sequence of cutting-planes that split the object recursively. Unlike existing algorithms, the planes are not chosen at random, rather they are derived from shape analysis routines that identify and resolve various commonly-found geometric configurations. In addition, we guide this search by a revised set of conditions that both ensure the objects' printability as well as realistically model the printing capabilities of the printer at hand. Evaluation of the new method demonstrates its ability to efficiently obtain support-free partitionings typically containing fewer parts compared to existing methods that rely on support-structures.},

abstract = {Functionally Graded Additive Manufacturing (FGAM) is a layer-by-layer fabrication process that involves gradationally varying the material organisation within a component to achieve an intended function. FGAM establishes a radical shift from contour modelling to performance modelling by having the performance-driven functionality built directly into the material. FGAM can strategically control the density and porosity of the composition or can combine distinct materials to produce a seamless monolithic structure. This paper presents a state-of-art conceptual understanding of FGAM, covering an overview of current techniques that can enable the production of FGAM parts as well as identify current technological limitations and challenges. The possible strategies for overcoming those barriers are presented and recommendations on future design opportunities are discussed.},

abstract = {In nature, cellular materials exhibit enhanced multifunctionalities driven mainly by their sophisticated topologies and length scales. These natural systems have inspired the development and expansion of synthetic architected materials for revolutionary applications. Consequently, both the design and synthesis techniques gained considerable attention and have massively progressed over the last few decades. Such materials with topology-controlled properties are commonly known as “metamaterials.” Architected materials with topologies based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) which are of particular interest have attracted much attention recently due to their mathematically controlled fascinating topologies and their exhibited physical and mechanical properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and use of TPMS in the field of metamaterials and metacomposites for several applications are focused upon. The design process to create TPMS-based 3D lattices is summarized and the different manufacturing processes used to fabricate these lattices are highlighted. Herein, the material–topology–mechanical properties relationship of different TPMS-based lattices that are investigated in the literature is discussed. A further objective is to highlight the applications where TPMS-based lattices or composites can be efficiently used as well as the research areas to be explored.},

abstract = {Offsetting-based hollowing is a solid modeling operation widely used in 3D printing, which can change the model's physical properties and reduce the weight by generating voids inside a model. However, a hollowing operation can lead to additional supporting structures for fabrication in interior voids, which cannot be removed. As a consequence, the result of a hollowing operation is affected by these additional supporting structures when applying the operation to optimize physical properties of different models. This paper proposes a support-free hollowing framework to overcome the difficulty of fabricating voids inside a solid. The challenge of computing a support-free hollowing is decomposed into a sequence of shape optimization steps, which are repeatedly applied to interior mesh surfaces. The optimization of physical properties in different applications can be easily integrated into our framework. Comparing to prior approaches that can generate support-free inner structures, our hollowing operation can reduce more volume of material and thus provide a larger solution space for physical optimization. Experimental tests are taken on a number of 3D models to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework.},

abstract = {Compared with widely applied tessellation mesh or parametric spline surfaces, implicit surfaces are more suitable for representing models with complicated topology and geometry. Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) is a kind of charming implicit surface talented at designing porous structures. Layered infill area generation is the crucial task of process planning for additive manufacturing (AM). Generally, the constructed TPMS are open surfaces with zero thickness, which cannot be directly fabricated. In this work, a complete method is proposed to generate layered infill areas from TPMS for AM. Initially, based on the Marching Squares (MS) algorithm, the TPMS can be efficiently sliced into numerous unstructured line segments. Afterwards, an efficient sorting algorithm with a linear time complexity is developed by special data structures to generate ordered slicing contours. Eventually, in virtue of the demonstrated bidirectional-offset-union strategy, close polygons can be generated as layered infill areas for path planning procedure to manufacture TPMS structures with uniform wall thickness. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and merits of the proposed approach, which can also be expanded to fabricate other complicated implicit surfaces via AM technology.},

Recent mathematical developments offer a resolution to this dilemma, thereby promising significant enhancements in the accuracy and speed of offset computations based on analytic solid model representations. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Recently, a paradigm shift is taking place in tissue engineering scaffold design from homogeneous porous scaffolds to functionally graded scaffolds that have heterogeneous internal structures with controlled porosity levels and architectures. This paper presents a new heterogeneous modeling methodology for designing tissue engineering scaffolds with precisely controlled porosity and internal architectures using triply periodic minimal surfaces. The internal architectures and porosity at the spatial locations of the scaffolds are determined based on a given distribution of architectures and porosity levels specified at a few selected points on the model. After generating the hexahedral elements for a 3D anatomical shape using the distance field algorithm, the unit cell libraries composed of triply periodic minimal surfaces are mapped into the subdivided hexahedral elements using the shape function widely used in the finite element method. By simply allocating parameter values related to the porosity and architecture type to the corner nodes in each hexahedral element, we can easily and precisely control the pore size, porosity, and architecture type at each region of the scaffold while preserving perfectly interconnected pore networks across the entire scaffold. {\textcopyright} KSPE and Springer 2012.},

abstract = {This paper presents a highly efficient method to obtain high-resolution, near-optimal 3D topologies optimized for minimum compliance on a standard PC. Using an implicit geometry description we derive a single-scale interpretation of optimal multi-scale designs on a very fine mesh (de-homogenization). By performing homogenization-based topology optimization, optimal multi-scale designs are obtained on a relatively coarse mesh resulting in a low computational cost. As microstructure parameterization we use orthogonal rank-3 microstructures, which are known to be optimal for a single loading case. Furthermore, a method to get explicit control of the minimum feature size and complexity of the final shapes will be discussed. Numerical examples show excellent performance of these fine-scale designs resulting in objective values similar to the homogenization-based designs. Comparisons with well-established density-based topology optimization methods show a reduction in computational cost of 3 orders of magnitude, paving the way for giga-scale designs on a standard PC.},

Considering the manufacturability of the structure designs and computational efficiency, additional parameters are introduced to define the microstructure unit cell patterns and their non-uniform distribution, which avoids expensive iterative numerical homogenization calculations during topology optimization and results in an easier modelling of structure designs as well. It is worth mentioning that the equivalent properties of material microstructures serve as a link between the macro and the micro scale with the help of homogenization theory and the Porous Anisotropic Material with Penalization (PAMP) model. Besides, sensitivities of global structure compliance with respect to the pseudo-density variables and the microstructure parameter variables are derived, respectively. Moreover, several numerical examples are presented and reasonable solutions have been obtained to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, mechanical testing is conducted to investigate the better performance of the optimized structure which is fabricated by 3D printing.},

The combination of nonplanar and planar layers results in smoother surfaces and the object is still printable on a three-axis 3D printer. Adding the ability to print nonplanar surfaces to an open-source slicer increases the usability and provides a general-purpose approach. This work presents a slicer that is capable of generating nonplanar toolpaths from any object. While printing, the printhead does not collide with the object since this is checked beforehand. The surface quality of objects with nonplanar layers is significantly better than with planar layers only.},

abstract = {This paper builds on our recent work (Xia and Breitkopf, 2014) on multiscale structural topology optimization where at the microscopic scale, local materials are optimized concurrently according to current loading status. The former design framework requires intensive computational cost due to large number of repetitive local material optimizations. To circumvent this limitation, in the present work, we construct a reduced database model viewing the local material optimization process as a generalized constitutive behavior using separated representations. In this model, the database is built from a set of numerical experiments of local material optimizations in the macroscopic strain tensor space. Each value in the database corresponds to the strain energy density evaluated on a material microstructure, optimized according to the imposed macroscopic strain. By tensor decomposition, a continuous representation of the strain energy density is built as a sum of products of one dimensional interpolation functions. As a result of this a priori off-line step, the effective strain-energy and stress-strain relations required for macroscopic structural evaluation and optimization are provided in a numerically explicit manner. The results given by the reduced database model are compared with full-scale results. It is also shown that this explicit constitutive behavior representation can well serve multiscale structural design at a significantly reduced computational cost. •An approximate constitutive model is built for local material microstructure using a database model.•The database is further reduced into a separated representation by means of tensor decomposition.•The approximate constitutive law can well serve structural design with a reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have emerged as a suitable tool for designing porous biomaterials. One of the well-known TPMS structures is the gyroid structure. Different types of gyroid porous structures (normal and deformed gyroid structures) with different porosities have been designed and fabricated by Electron Beam Melting technology with the purpose of analysing the mechanical properties under compression and torsion loads. Then, some of them have also been studied by finite element method for different load directions. The compression tests demonstrated that the deformed gyroids presented high stiffness and strength with loads in the longitudinal direction of the structures, especially when the deformed gyroids were reinforced with a shell. The torsion tests showed that the normal gyroids presented better torsional stiffness and strength than the deformed gyroids, with high CAD porosities (90{\%}). However, no significant differences between both structures were found for low CAD porosities (75{\%}). Finite element analysis showed that when the loads adopted a 45° angle with regard to the longitudinal axis of the structure, the normal gyroids presented more homogeneous behaviour than the deformed gyroids. In summary, gyroid porous titanium structures presented good and versatile stiffness and strength to be used for correction of bone defects.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing transforms material into three-dimensional parts incrementally, layer by layer or path by path. Subject to the build direction and machine resolution, an additively manufactured part deviates from its design model in terms of both geometry and mechanical performance. In particular, the material inside the fabricated part often exhibits spatially varying material distribution (heterogeneity) and direction dependent behavior (anisotropy), indicating that the design model is no longer a suitable surrogate to consistently estimate the mechanical performance of the printed component. We propose a new two-stage approach to modeling and estimating effective elastic properties of parts fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. First, we construct an implicit representation of an effective mesoscale geometry-material model of the printed structure that captures the details of the particular process and published material information. This representation of mesoscale geometry and material of the printed structure is then homogenized at macro scale through a solution of an integral equation formulated using Green's function. We show that the integral equation can be converted into a system of linear equations that is symmetric and positive definite and can be solved efficiently using conjugate gradient method and Fourier transform. The computed homogenized properties are validated by both finite element method and experiment results. The proposed two-stage approach can be used to estimate other effective material properties in a variety of additive manufacturing processes, whenever a similar effective mesoscale geometry-material model can be constructed.},

abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive tool path generation method for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). The proposed method consists of three steps. First, an adaptive slicing considering both surface quality and building time is proposed for following tool path generation. Second, a hybrid tool path strategy is introduced to improve the boundary contours accuracy. This step is an adaptive process to choose an appropriate proportional relationship between the two types of tool paths according to the specific fabrication requirements. For further improvement, a tool path adjustment is employed on the original tool paths. A case study of a sliced layer is used to verify the feasibility and advantage of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Lightweight structures with slender features and thin walls can be fabricated by the additive manufacturing process. The fabrication process utilizes a contour parallel toolpath, where sets of parallel contours are offset from the boundaries of a geometric structure at predefined intervals to deposit the material layer by layer. Currently, these intervals are set to be constant, which limits its capability to produce near net-shape parts. In recent research, the feasibility to fabricate parts using contour parallel toolpaths with variable bead widths has been explored to increase the production speed, to improve the geometry accuracy, and to manufacture void-free parts. However, existing process planning methods are computationally inefficient and challenging to implement. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive process planning framework for adaptive contour parallel toolpath with variable bead widths. More specifically, this framework includes a toolpath planning algorithm using the level-set method and a process planning algorithm for generating the desired bead geometry using a Gaussian process regression model. To validate the proposed framework, a case study has been demonstrated in the fabrication of benchmark features with a wire and arc additive manufacturing process. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Process planning of additive manufacturing of metals is a research interest because of the applications of solid freeform fabrication of metal parts in industry. The strategy is to transform the model of the part into the combinations of 2D layers that will be deposited using different fabrication methods. Process planning for metal deposition in this paper consists of three major modules: spatial decomposition, slicing of the part, and toolpath generation for every slicing layer. Algorithmic improvements are proposed and implemented for these major modules. For spatial decomposition, 3D part decomposition based on modular boundary models and centroidal axis extraction methods are combined to decompose parts more robustly and reliably. For generating slicing layers, a planning process for building non-uniform layers is investigated to greatly increase the variety of the parts that can be manufactured without the need of support structure. For toolpath generation methods, optimization of the generated toolpath is studied especially for complex thin-wall structures to ensure the deposition quality. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the improvements of the major modules of process planning strategies for rapid manufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.},

abstract = {Ketogenic diets (KDs), successfully used in the therapy of paediatric epilepsy for nearly a century, have recently shown beneficial effects also in cancer, obesity, diabetes, GLUT 1 deficiencies, hypoxia-ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and neurodegeneration. The latter achievement designates aged individuals as optimal recipients, but concerns derive from possible age-dependent differences in KDs effectiveness. Indeed, the main factors influencing ketone bodies utilization by the brain (blood levels, transport mechanisms, catabolic enzymes) undergo developmental changes, although several reports indicate that KDs maintain some efficacy during adulthood and even during advanced aging. Encouraging results obtained in patients affected by age-related neurodegenerative diseases have prompted new interest on KDs' effect on the aging brain, also considering the poor efficacy of therapies currently used. However, recent morphological evidence in synapses of late-adult rats indicates that KDs consequences may be even opposite in different brain regions, likely depending on neuronal vulnerability to age. Thus, further studies are needed to design KDs specifically indicated for single neurodegenerative diseases, and to ameliorate the balance between beneficial and adverse effects in aged subjects. Here we review clinical and experimental data on KDs treatments, focusing on their possible use during pathological aging. Proposed mechanisms of action are also reported and discussed.},

A widely used practice to fabricate such models is by layer-based additive manufacturing (AM), which however suffers from the problem of adding and removing interior supporting structures. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating application-specific infill structures on rhombic cells so that the resultant structures can automatically satisfy manufacturing requirements on overhang-angle and wall-thickness. Additional supporting structures can be avoided entirely in our framework. To achieve this, we introduce the usage of an adaptive rhombic grid, which is built from an input surface model. Starting from the initial sparse set of rhombic cells, via numerical optimization techniques an objective function can be improved by adaptively subdividing the rhombic grid and thus adding more walls in cells. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generating interior designs in the applications of improving mechanical stiffness and static stability.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general mathematic approach to model the microstructures of porous structures produced by additive manufacturing (AM), which will result in fractal surface topography and higher roughness that have greater influence on the performance of porous structures. Design/methodology/approach - The overall shapes of pores were modeled by triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), and the micro-roughness details attached to the overall pore shapes were represented by Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) fractal representation, which was integrated with TPMS along its normal vectors. An index roughly reflecting the irregularity of fractal TPMS was proposed, based on which the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was qualitatively analyzed. Two complex samples of real porous structures were given to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. Findings - The fractal surface topography should not be neglected at a micro-scale level. In addition, a decrease in the fractal dimension Ds may exponentially make the topography rougher; an increase in the height-scaling parameter G may linearly increase the roughness; and the number of the superposed ridges has no distinct influence on the topography. Furthermore, the synthesis method is general for all implicit surfaces. Practical implications - The method provides an alternative way to shift the posteriori design paradigm of porous media to priori design mode through numeric simulation. Therefore, the optimization of AM process parameters, as well as the porous structure, can be potentially realized according to specific functional requirement. Originality/value - The synthesis of TPMS and W-M fractal geometry was accomplished efficiently and was general for all implicit freeform surfaces, and the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was analyzed more systematically. {\textcopyright} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The potential of topology optimization to amplify the benefits of additive manufacturing (AM), by fully exploiting the vast design space that AM allows, is widely recognized. However, existing topology optimization approaches do not consider AM-specific limitations during the design process, resulting in designs that are not self-supporting. This leads to additional effort and costs in post-processing and use of sacrificial support structures. To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a topology optimization formulation that includes a simplified AM fabrication model implemented as a layerwise filtering procedure. Unprintable geometries are effectively excluded from the design space, resulting in fully self-supporting optimized designs. The procedure is demonstrated on numerical examples involving compliance minimization, eigenfrequency maximization and compliant mechanism design. Despite the applied restrictions, in suitable orientations fully printable AM-restrained designs matched the performance of reference designs obtained by conventional topology optimization.},

Design/methodology/approach Three geometric variables (inclination, included and incidence angle) were defined for an edge. The influence of each variable on the geometric errors was explained with reference to specific causes related to physical phenomena and process constraints. Findings Occurrence conditions for all causes were determined and visualized in a process map, which was also developed into a software procedure for the diagnosis of quality issues on digital models of the parts. Research limitations/implications The process map was developed by only empirical considerations and does not allow to predict the amount of geometric errors. In the second part of the paper, experimental tests will help to extend and validate the prediction criteria. Practical implications As demonstrated by an example, the results allow to predict the occurrence of visible defects on the edges of a part before manufacturing it with a given build orientation. Originality/value In literature, the geometric accuracy of additively manufactured parts is only related to surface features. The paper shows that the quality of edges depends on additional variables and causes to be carefully controlled by process choices.},

That proposed approach involves the tiling of the domain of a deformation map using copies of a tile. The resulting tiling is functionally composed into the deformation map to obtain freeform micro-structures. Such a decoupling of the micro and macro structures allows a simplified control over design parameters. Herein, we present several extensions to this micro-structure construction scheme, comprising bivariate and trivariate tiles, implicit and parametric, including with potential discontinuities. We present support for fractal-like micro-structures, with self-similarity, allow the encoding of volumetric properties and hence heterogeneity, support for shelling and capping boundary operations, random tiling and bifurcation tiling, and support for degree reduction of the result. We verify the robustness of our approach by subjecting some of our heterogeneous micro-structures to isogeometric analysis. Finally, a variety of results from an implementation of our algorithms are also presented.},

abstract = {Additively manufactured parts are often composed of two sub-structures, a solid shell forming their exterior and a porous infill occupying the interior. To account for this feature this paper presents a novel method for generating simultaneously optimized shell and infill in the context of minimum compliance topology optimization. Our method builds upon two recently developed approaches that extend density-based topology optimization: A coating approach to obtain an optimized shell that is filled uniformly with a prescribed porous base material, and an infill approach which generates optimized, non-uniform infill within a prescribed shell. To evolve the shell and infill concurrently, our formulation assigns two sets of design variables: One set defines the base and the coating, while the other set defines the infill structures. The resulting intermediate density distributions are unified by a material interpolation model into a physical density field, upon which the compliance is minimized. Enhanced by an adapted robust formulation for controlling the minimum length scale of the base, our method generates optimized shell–infill composites suitable for additive manufacturing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on numerical examples, and analyse the influence of different design specifications.},

The optimization aims at achieving a quadtree structure with the highest mechanical stiffness, where the edges in the quadtree are interpreted as structural elements carrying mechanical loads. We formulate quadtree optimization as a continuous material distribution problem. The discrete design variables (i.e., to refine or not to refine) are replaced by continuous variables on multiple levels in the quadtree hierarchy. In discrete quadtree optimization, a cell is only eligible for refinement if its parent cell has been refined. We propose a continuous analogue to this dependency for continuous multi-level design variables, and integrate it in the iterative optimization process. Our results show that the continuously optimized quadtree structures perform much stiffer than uniform patterns and the heuristically optimized counterparts. We demonstrate the use of adaptive structures as lightweight infill for 3D printed parts, where uniform geometric patterns have been typically used in practice.},

Despite the associated opportunities for innovation, the use of support material also introduces a series of limitations: additional material cost, cost of removal of support material, potential contamination of biocompatible materials, and entrapment of support material within cellular structures. This work presents a strategy for minimising the use of support material by comparing the geometric limits of an additive manufacture process to the build angles that exist within a proposed geometry. This method generates a feasibility map of the feasible build orientations for a proposed geometry with a given process. The method is applied to polyhedra that are suitable for close packing to identify space-filling tessellated structures that can be selfsupporting. The integrity of an FDM process is quantified, and using the associated feasibility map, self-supporting polyhedra are manufactured. These polyhedra are integrated with non-trivial geometries to achieve a reduction in consumed material of approximately 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {This paper presents a level set-based topology optimization method considering the overhang constraint in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Though the combination of the topology optimization and AM shows a promising potential and high design flexibility, there are still certain limitations. The overhang constraint is one of the major issues that need to be considered in the design stage. It requires the inclination angles of structural downward-facing surfaces to be larger than a given lower bound, so as to prevent the structure from warping or collapsing during the AM process. We propose a new form of overhang constraint in the level set framework, which is expressed as a single domain integral instead of point-wise constraints. This domain integral form facilitates the detection of overhang constraint violation. The shape derivative of the overhang constraint is derived by using the signed distance property of the level set function. The proposed method is capable of dealing with constraints with different minimum overhang angles. Theoretically, it allows the optimization to proceed from an arbitrary structural layout, without the need to satisfy the overhang constraint in the initial design. Several numerical examples are given to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is seen in these examples that the overhang constraint is satisfied mainly by adjusting the local shape of structural members violating the overhang constraint during the optimization process. Thus, the overhang angle constrained optimization can generate similar load paths as in conventional optimal designs in most cases, without significantly worsening the structural stiffness.},

@article{Hornus2016b,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a process by which a three dimensional object is created layer after layer, through selective deposition of material. It often requires the automated generation of auxiliary shapes, to temporarily support the object, to protect its surface, or to carve inner cavities and reduce material usage. In this context, we define a printable enclosure as a minimal volume enclosing a given shape and whose boundary can be printed at the smallest possible thickness while ensuring proper bonding between layers. Such an enclosure is well suited to serve as auxiliary structure for additive manufacturing: it is easy to print and require little material. In this paper, we demonstrate its use on three different applications: enclosing a print within protective walls that are close to the surface; generating large inner cavities whose walls are printable, and finally modeling support structures that provide a dense support to the downward facing surfaces while vanishing as quickly as possible below the supported object. We obtain the shape of an enclosure by considering constraints on its set of slices along horizontal planes. In practice, the set of slices is discrete and the constraints afford for an efficient sweep-like construction algorithm using morphological operations on the slices. We discuss the printability and optimality of the enclosures and their boundary walls.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) enables enormous freedom for design of complex structures. However, the process-dependent limitations that result in discrepancies between as-designed and as-manufactured shapes are not fully understood. The tradeoffs between infinitely many different ways to approximate a design by a manufacturable replica are even harder to characterize. To support design for AM (DfAM), one has to quantify local discrepancies introduced by AM processes, identify the detrimental deviations (if any) to the original design intent, and prescribe modifications to the design and/or process parameters to countervail their effects. Our focus in this work will be on topological analysis. There is ample evidence in many applications that preserving local topology (e.g., connectivity of beams in a lattice) is important even when slight geometric deviations can be tolerated. We first present a generic method to characterize local topological discrepancies due to material under- and over-deposition in AM, and show how it captures various types of defects in the as-manufactured structures. We use this information to systematically modify the as-manufactured outcomes within the limitations of available 3D printer resolution(s), which often comes at the expense of introducing more geometric deviations (e.g., thickening a beam to avoid disconnection). We validate the effectiveness of the method on 3D examples with nontrivial topologies such as lattice structures and foams.},

The latter achievement designates aged individuals as optimal recipients, but concerns derive from possible age-dependent differences in KDs effectiveness. Indeed, the main factors influencing ketone bodies utilization by the brain (blood levels, transport mechanisms, catabolic enzymes) undergo developmental changes, although several reports indicate that KDs maintain some efficacy during adulthood and even during advanced aging. Encouraging results obtained in patients affected by age-related neurodegenerative diseases have prompted new interest on KDs' effect on the aging brain, also considering the poor efficacy of therapies currently used. However, recent morphological evidence in synapses of late-adult rats indicates that KDs consequences may be even opposite in different brain regions, likely depending on neuronal vulnerability to age. Thus, further studies are needed to design KDs specifically indicated for single neurodegenerative diseases, and to ameliorate the balance between beneficial and adverse effects in aged subjects. Here we review clinical and experimental data on KDs treatments, focusing on their possible use during pathological aging. Proposed mechanisms of action are also reported and discussed.},

@article{Hergel2014,
abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication is an additive manufacturing process by which a 3D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a hot nozzle where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted side by side on the printer carriage. However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed - a disappointment for designers interested in 3D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality - on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum {\textcopyright} 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.

abstract = {One crucial component of the additive manufacturing software toolchain is a class of geometric algorithms known as “slicers.” The purpose of the slicer is to compute a parametric toolpath and associated commands, which direct an additive manufacturing system to produce a physical realization of a three-dimensional input model. Existing slicing algorithms operate by application of geometric transformations upon the input geometry in order to produce the toolpath. In this paper we introduce a new implicit slicing algorithm based on the computation of toolpaths derived from the level sets of arbitrary heuristics-based or physics-based fields defined over the input geometry. This enables computationally efficient slicing of arbitrarily complex geometries in a straight forward fashion. Additionally, the calculation of component “infill” (as a process control parameter) is explored due to its crucial effect on functional performance fields of interest such as strain and stress distributions. Several examples of the application of the proposed implicit slicer are presented. Finally, an example demonstrating improved structural performance during physical testing is presented. We conclude with remarks regarding the strengths of the implicit approach relative to existing explicit approaches, and discuss future work required in order to extend the methodology.},

abstract = {The fabrication flexibility of 3D printing has sparked a lot of interest in designing structures with spatially graded material properties. In this paper, we propose a new type of density graded structure that is particularly designed for 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion. In order to ensure high-quality fabrication results, extrusion-based 3D printing requires not only that the structures are self-supporting, but also that extrusion toolpaths are continuous and free of self-overlap. The structure proposed in this paper, called CrossFill, complies with these requirements. In particular, CrossFill is a self-supporting foam structure, for which each layer is fabricated by a single, continuous and overlap-free path of material extrusion. Our method for generating CrossFill is based on a space-filling surface that employs spatially varying subdivision levels. Dithering of the subdivision levels is performed to accurately reproduce a prescribed density distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossFill on a number of experimental tests and applications.},

This work presents halftoning techniques to manufacture 3D objects with the appearance of full grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous paths. A set of three methods is presented which apply a linear halftoning principle called 'hatching' to horizontal, vertical and diagonal surfaces. These methods are better suited to FDM compared to other halftoning methods: their applicability stands irrespective of the geometry and surface slope and the perceived tone is less sensitive to the viewing angle. Furthermore, the methods have little effect on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results. Future work is required to optimize the interaction between the presented methods.},

abstract = {The onset of affordable AM printers has democratized digital manufacturing and enabled rapid growth of the AM industry. The recent advancement of AM technology has allowed for fabrication of highly complex parts that were difficult to produce using traditional manufacturing techniques. However, designers and novice users of additive technologies often lack the awareness of manufacturing considerations leading to lower quality parts and print failures. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an automated system that can analyze and correct designs before they are sent for fabrication so that wasteful iterations of build–test–redesign can be minimized. This paper outlines fundamental geometric reasoning algorithms to enable 3D print quality assessment. The developed algorithms computationally recognize potential printing problems in a given 3D model and suggest automatic local geometric changes to the 3D model to rectify the identified printing problems. The potential problems are identified using variations of shape diameter function and morphological operations. Also, a physics-based mesh deformation scheme is developed to make localized corrections to slices for improving printability. The utility of the developed approach has been demonstrated on both 2D slice and 3D model level corrections.},

Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.},

We propose here an easily implemented route to the triangulation of simple polygons through the trapezoidization of simple polygons, which is currently done in O(n log n). Then the trapezoidized polygons are triangu- lated in O(n) time. Both of those steps can be performed on polygons with holes with the same complexity. We also show in this paper that a number of problems, such as the decomposition of simple polygons into convex, star, monotone, spiral, and trapezoidal polygons and the determination of edge- vertex visibility, are linearly equivalent to the triangulation problem and therefore share the same lower bound. It is hoped that this will simplify the task of reducing the gap between the lower and upper bound for these problems.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new method for triangulating a simple n-sided polygon. The algorithm runs in time O(n log s), with s {\_}{\textless} n. The quantity s measures the sinuosity of the polygon, that is, the number of times the boundary alternates between complete spirals of opposite orientation. The value of s is in practice a very small constant, even for extremely winding polygons. Our algorithm is the first method whose performance is linear in the number of vertices, up to within a factor that depends only on the shape-complexity of the polygon. Informally, this notion of shape-complexity measures how entangled a polygon is, and is thus highly independent of the number of vertices. A practical advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require sorting or the use of any balanced tree structure. Aside from the notion of sinuosity, we are also able to characterize a large class of polygons for which the algorithm can be proven to run in O(n log log n) time. The algorithm has been implemented, tested, and empirical evidence has confirmed its theoretical claim to efficiency.},

A two-scale optimization is performed, where not only is the structural configuration optimized, but the effective properties of the constituent material are also designed by optimizing the configuration of the periodically-arranged microstructures. In this way, the approach can simultaneously generate optimized material distribution patterns as well as optimized materials. Due to the fact that the level set method produces material-void solutions only, the obtained material is uniformly distributed over the material regions of the structure in a strict sense. Three numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. The obtained optimal solutions illustrate that whether to design material cells or to optimize structural configurations to achieve the best structural performance would be problem dependent, and thus further demonstrate the necessity and validity of the integrated design scheme.},

@article{Massarwi2019,
abstract = {3D objects, modeled using Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) tools, are traditionally represented using a boundary representation (B-rep), and typically use spline functions to parameterize these boundary surfaces. However, recent development in physical analysis, in isogeometric analysis (IGA) in specific, necessitates a volumetric parametrization of the interior of the object. IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of the volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product B-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general 3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically represented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality of the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi and Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements. However, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more difficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly challenging task Xu et al. (2017). In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely decomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the boundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify the integration process, in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first subdivided into a set of trimmed B{\'{e}}zier trivariates, at all its internal knots. Then, each trimmed B{\'{e}}zier trivariate, is decomposed into a set of mutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover the entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed in either the Euclidean space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We present examples of the algorithm on complex trimmed trivariates' based geometry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the (untrimmed) results.},

abstract = {Adaptive slicing is an important computational task required in the layer-based manufacturing process. Its purpose is to find an optimal trade-off between the fabrication time (number of layers) and the surface quality (geometric deviation error). Most of the traditional adaptive slicing algorithms are computationally expensive or only based on local evaluation of errors. To tackle these problems, we introduce a method to efficiently generate slicing plans by a new metric profile that can characterize the distribution of deviation errors along the building direction. By generalizing the conventional error metrics, the proposed metric profile is a density function of deviation errors, which measures the global deviation errors rather than the in-plane local geometry errors used in most prior methods. Slicing can be efficiently evaluated based on metric profiles in contrast to the expensive computation on models in boundary-representation. An efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming is proposed to find the best slicing plan. Our adaptive slicing method can also be applied to models with weighted features and can serve as the inner loop to search the best building direction. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by experimental tests on different examples.},

The essential idea is to make a coordinate perturbation to the topology description functions (TDF) that are employed for the description of component/void geometries in the design domain. Then, the optimal graded structure design can be obtained by optimizing the coefficients in the perturbed basis functions. Our numerical examples show that the proposed approach enables a concurrent optimization of both the primitive cell and the graded material distribution in a straightforward and computationally effective way.

Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to propose a homogenization-based topology optimization method to optimize the design of variable-density cellular structure, in order to achieve lightweight design and overcome some of the manufacturability issues in additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - First, homogenization is performed to capture the effective mechanical properties of cellular structures through the scaling law as a function their relative density. Second, the scaling law is used directly in the topology optimization algorithm to compute the optimal density distribution for the part being optimized. Third, a new technique is presented to reconstruct the computer-aided design (CAD) model of the optimal variable-density cellular structure. The proposed method is validated by comparing the results obtained through homogenized model, full-scale simulation and experimentally testing the optimized parts after being additive manufactured. Findings - The test examples demonstrate that the homogenization-based method is efficient, accurate and is able to produce manufacturable designs. Originality/value - The optimized designs in our examples also show significant increase in stiffness and strength when compared to the original designs with identical overall weight.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approximate algorithm for medial axis transform of a plane domain. The underlying philosophy of our approach is the localization idea based on the Domain Decomposition Lemma, which enables us to break up the complicated domain into smaller and simpler pieces. We then develop tree data structure and various operations on it to keep track of the information produced by the domain decomposition procedure. This strategy enables us to isolate various important points such as branch points and terminal points. Because our data structure guarantees the existence of such important points - in fact, our data structure is devised with this in mind - we can zoom in on those points. This makes our algorithm efficient. Our algorithm is a "from within" approach, whereas traditional methods use a "from-the-boundary" approach. This "from within" nature of our algorithm and the localization scheme help mitigate various instability phenomena, thereby making our algorithm reasonably robust. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Abstract The medial axis of a surface in 3D is the closure of all points that have two or more closest points on the surface. It is an essential geometric structure in a number of applications involving 3D geometric shapes. Since exact computation of the medial axis is difficult in general, efforts continue to improve their approximations. Voronoi diagrams turn out to be useful for this approximation. Although it is known that Voronoi vertices for a sample of points from a curve in 2D approximate its medial axis, a similar result does not hold in 3D. Recently, it has been discovered that only a subset of Voronoi vertices converge to the medial axis as sample density approaches infinity. However, most applications need a nondiscrete approximation as opposed to a discrete one. To date no known algorithm can compute this approximation straight from the Voronoi diagram with a guarantee of convergence. We present such an algorithm and its convergence analysis in this paper. One salient feature of the algorithm is that it is scale and density independent. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical claims.},

The complexity of the algorithm varies based on the error threshold that is used, and is a linear function of the input size.

abstract = {The medial axis transform (or MAT) is a representation of an object as an infinite union of balls. We consider approximating the MAT of a three-dimensional object, and its complement, with a finite union of balls. Using this approximate MAT we define a new piecewise-linear approximation to the object surface, which we call the power crust. We assume that we are given as input a sufficiently dense sample of points from the object surface. We select a subset of the Voronoi balls of the sample, the polar balls, as the union of balls representation. We bound the geometric error of the union, and of the corresponding power crust, and show that both representations are topologically correct as well. Thus, our results provide a new algorithm for surface reconstruction from sample points. By construction, the power crust is always the boundary of a polyhedral solid, so we avoid the polygonization, hole-filling or manifold extraction steps used in previous algorithms. The union of balls representation and the power crust have corresponding piecewise-linear dual representations, which in some sense approximate the medial axis. We show a geometric relationship between these duals and the medial axis by proving that, as the sampling density goes to infinity, the set of poles, the centers of the polar balls, converges to the medial axis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

To achieve the continuity in both structural geometry and mechanical properties, irregularly smooth porous structures, which have naturally realistic appearance, are designed by combining 3D Voronoi diagrams and skeleton-based implicit surfaces. A procedural modeling method integrating additive manufacturing (AM) is developed for avoiding the FGPM full representations which consume tremendous computational memory. For easily mapping the graded porous structures to yield tailored elasticity distributions, a mapping model from the elasticity distribution to the density field is formulated. The method is experimentally and numerically validated. Additionally, the compression tests showed the superior mechanical performance compared to straight-beam-based foams, and the stiffness and strength of the foam are found to be improved as a result of FGPMs. This research opens up a new route of tailoring the novel foams.},

abstract = {Recent multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) technologies enable the fabrication of an object with accurate deposition of different types of materials. Hence, in addition to geometric shapes, it is possible to use different material compositions to optimize the mechanical properties of a component for given design requirements. However, current AM processes have a limitation on the number of materials that can be deposited during the fabrication process. Due to the constraint, it is critical to optimize the material distribution using the limited base materials; however, an extremely large design space exists in a design domain that is enabled by the AM technologies. In this paper, we introduce a digital material design framework to generate digital material compositions that can be printed and be able to achieve the desired behavior. We take analog material composition as the input and perform the analog-to-digital conversion using an exemplar-based approach based on a pre-computed material library. The patterns in the library are constructed with different combinations of the given base materials, and their mechanical properties are computed using finite element simulation. Accordingly, the design goal of the analog-to-digital conversion is to find material composition in the design domain with matching mechanical properties. A tensor-based error diffusion algorithm has been developed to reduce the approximation error during the conversion effectively. Experimental tests based on the design framework have been performed. The test results demonstrate that our framework can quickly find effective solutions for various multi-material design problems.},

@article{Cheng2019,
abstract = {Advances in additive manufacturing (AM) have drawn considerable interest due to its ability to produce geometrically complex structure, such as lattice materials. In this work, a novel methodology is proposed to design graded lattice structure through topology optimization under stress constraint, in order to generate lightweight lattice structure design with predictable yield performance. Instead of using the power law of material interpolation in the SIMP method, asymptotic homogenization method is employed to compute the effective elastic properties of lattice material in terms of design variable, i.e. relative density. For yield strength, a multiscale failure model is proposed to capture yield strength of microstructure with macroscopic stress. At macroscale, a modified Hill's yield criterion is employed to describe anisotropic yield strength of lattice material. The material constants in Hill's model are assumed to be a function of relative density, and thus a model is built up to formulate yield strength of lattice structure with macroscopic stress. The experimental verification on the printed samples demonstrates that both the homogenized elastic model and yield model can accurately describe the elasticity and plasticity of the lattice structure. Based on the proposed material interpolation for lattice structure, a lattice structure topology optimization framework is proposed for minimizing total weight of the structure under stress constraint. The sensitivity analysis is performed for the implementation of the optimization algorithm. Two three-dimensionally numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, as well as accuracy of the proposed homogenization technique for graded lattice structure design. Experiment is conducted to systematically examine yielding of the optimally graded lattice structure design and compare its performance with a uniform structure. It is found that the proposed optimization framework is valid for the design examples examined and can significantly enhance mechanical performance of the structure (i.e. yield loading, stiffness, energy absorption, etc.)},

The concurrent design optimizes configuration of the PM at the microscopic level and coordinates the compatible generated GMs at the macroscopic level in a double-loop manner, which ensures a sufficiently large design space. Numerical examples demonstrate that, compared to the one-scale design strategy, i.e. the macrostructure topology optimization and the homogeneous microstructure design method, the proposed approach is able to produce remarkably improved optimized solutions.

Thanks to the properties of being lightweight, sustainable and cost efficient, it has been applied to a great extent in material engineering, meanwhile achieving much attention in shape optimization for 3D printing. However, current efforts on modeling porous structures in a given shape either consider uniform pore distributions, or regard the physical constraints as an underlying scalar field, both generating pores in an isotropic manner. The limitation is that the intrinsic directional properties of some physical terms like stresses or elasticities are not considered. It is still challenging to adapt the porous structure with the input tensor field. In this paper, we present an algorithm for modeling anisotropic porous structure, based on anisotropic centroidal Voronoi tessellations and an iteratively optimization framework in a 2.5D domain. Comparisons with isotropic porous structures show that our anisotropic structures have better adaption with the stress tensor field and thus gain better strength-to-weight ratio for the 3D printed model.},

Results from Finite Element (FE) analysis for the two loading scenarios considered: intended loading, and variability in loading, provide insight into the solution optimality and robustness of the design strategies. Lattice strategies that capitalised on TO results were found to be considerably (∼40–50{\%}) superior in terms of specific stiffness when compared to the structures where this was not the case.

abstract = {ABSTRACTAdditive manufacturing (AM) is becoming increasingly popular because of its unique advantages. However, AM still suffers from support material waste during the fabrication process when overhanging features exist. Plenty of research has been carried out for minimising support usage. However, former studies only focused on the optimisation for a single part fabrication. In this paper, a four-step strategy of multi-part production for reducing support consumption in AM is proposed. When printing a group of parts in the same build vat or chamber, the proposed strategy optimises the print orientation for each part, combines every two parts based on the geometries, proposes several possible multi-part combinations, and then selects the optimal part positions for fabrication. Two case studies are carried out for verification. The results show that the four-step strategy can significantly reduce the support waste and total fabrication time.},

abstract = {The emergence of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies brings in the reduction of material consumption in terms of avoiding the repeated fabrication of dies as well as comparatively high material efficiency. However, despite of widespread application and evident advantages over conventional manufacturing techniques, AM still suffers from long lead time and redundant material usage when fabricating large-volume solid objects. This fact would definitely restrict the diffusion of AM technology. Based on this, a design strategy is proposed in this paper from the perspective of process planning focusing on the material consumption in additive manufacturing of relatively large-volume solid parts. Instead of processing the digital models directly, the sliced data of digital models is adopted for the design and optimization, and finally outputting the paths driving the AM machine to realize the practical fabrication. The sliced contours of the model are obtained based on a given layer thickness at first. Subsequently, the areas to be filled on each layer are determined according to the input contours and the self-supporting capability of the material. The interior regions confined by the generated internal contours do not need to be filled necessarily because they have no effect on the parts' geometry and the materials can be saved accordingly. At last, a skeleton-based path planning method is utilized to address the long and narrow geometry to improve the deposition performance and surface quality. Several tests are used to verify the proposed strategy and the results show its effectiveness and feasibility in reducing the material consumption, enabling AM to be a more environmental friendly and sustainable manufacturing method.},

abstract = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a layer wise production technique enabling the production of complex metallic parts. In the SLM process parts are built by selectively melting subsequent layers of powder by a laser beam. Nowadays during SLM fixed scan parameters are used (laser power, scan velocity and scan pattern) that should ensure the formation of a sufficiently large and stable melt pool fusing powder particles together. The stability of the melt pool formed during SLM should ensure adequate part accuracy, surface roughness and part density, and thus good mechanical properties. However, the local geometry of the part being build has a large influence on the thermal behavior in and around the melt pool and therefore on the quality of features, mainly when melting along thin walls, sharp corners or down facing layers (layers above powder) that largely influences the local thermal behavior. Detecting such features from the CAD model and using locally adapted scanning parameters for processing those features enables to optimize the quality and density of the part, independently of its local geometry. This paper studies strategies to build thin walls with correct dimensions using locally optimized scan parameters.},

The pocket may be an arbitrary simply-connected 2D shape bounded by straight-line segments and circular arcs. The tool path is generated by interpolating growing disks placed on the medial axis of the pocket. It starts inside the pocket and spirals out to the pocket boundary. The tool path is guaranteed to be free of self-intersections and allows machining of the pocket without tool retractions. The start point of the spiral may be chosen freely by the user anywhere within the pocket. Most importantly, the spiral tool path complies with a user-specified maximum cutting width. The output of our algorithm is a G1-continuous spiral path. However, in a post-processing step, a properly adapted variant of the recent "PowerApx" package [Heimlich M, Held M. Biarc approximation, simplification and smoothing of polygonal curves by means of Voronoi-based tolerance bands.

@article{Huang2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME. High-speed machine tools typically provide high spindle speeds and feedrates to achieve an effective material removal rate (MRR). However, it is not possible to realize the full extent of their high-speed capabilities due to the sharp corners of toolpaths which are introduced by conventional machining strategies, such as contour- and direction-parallel toolpaths. To address this limitation, spiral toolpaths that can reduce the magnitude of sudden direction changes have been developed in previous researches. Nevertheless, for some pockets, the average radial cutting width is significantly decreased while the total length of the toolpath is significantly increased as compared to contour- and directionparallel toolpath. In this situation, spiral toolpath may take more machining time. To overcome these drawbacks, an aggressive spiral toolpath generation method based on the medial axis (MA) transformation is proposed in machining pocket without islands inside, which refers to no additional material inside the counter. The salient feature of this work is that it integrates the advantages of both conventional contour-parallel machining strategy and the existing spiral toolpath machining strategy. The cutting width at each MA point is determined based on the diameter of the locally inscribed circle (LIC) of the MA point and the topological structure of MA. A distance-constrained contour determination algorithm is utilized to calculate the toolpath for each pass. Finally, a circular arc transition strategy is used to transform all the isolated passes into a spiral toolpath. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {A novel tissue scaffold design technique has been proposed with controllable heterogeneous architecture design suitable for additive manufacturing processes. The proposed layer-based design uses a bi-layer pattern of radial and spiral layers consecutively to generate functionally gradient porosity, which follows the geometry of the scaffold. The proposed approach constructs the medial region from the medial axis of each corresponding layer, which represents the geometric internal feature or the spine. The radial layers of the scaffold are then generated by connecting the boundaries of the medial region and the layer's outer contour. To avoid the twisting of the internal channels, reorientation and relaxation techniques are introduced to establish the point matching of ruling lines. An optimization algorithm is developed to construct sub-regions from these ruling lines. Gradient porosity is changed between the medial region and the layer's outer contour. Iso-porosity regions are determined by dividing the sub-regions peripherally into pore cells and consecutive iso-porosity curves are generated using the iso-points from those pore cells. The combination of consecutive layers generates the pore cells with desired pore sizes. To ensure the fabrication of the designed scaffolds, the generated contours are optimized for a continuous, interconnected, and smooth deposition path-planning. A continuous zig-zag pattern deposition path crossing through the medial region is used for the initial layer and a biarc fitted iso-porosity curve is generated for the consecutive layer with C1 continuity. The proposed methodologies can generate the structure with gradient (linear or non-linear), variational or constant porosity that can provide localized control of variational porosity along the scaffold architecture. The designed porous structures can be fabricated using additive manufacturing processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to develop a set of process parameters tailored for lattice structures and test them against standard process (SP) parameters. Selective laser melting (SLM) is a commonly known and established additive manufacturing technique and is a key technology in generating intricately shaped lattice structures. However, SP parameters used in this technology have building time and accuracy disadvantages for structures with a low area-to-perimeter ratio, such as thin struts. Design/methodology/approach - In this research work, body-centred cubic structure specimens are manufactured using adapted process parameters. Central to the adapted process parameters is the positioning of the laser beam, the scan strategy and the linear energy density. The specimens are analysed with X-ray micro-computed tomography for dimensional accuracy. The final assessment is a comparison between specimens manufactured using adapted process parameters and those using SP parameters. Findings - Standard parameters for lattice structures lead to a significant shift from the nominal geometry. An extensive manufacturing and computation time due to several exposure patterns (e.g. pre-contours, post-contours) was observed. The tailored process parameters developed had good dimensional accuracy, reproducible results and improved manufacturing performance. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on a distinctive geometry of the lattice structure and a specific material. Future research should be extended to other geometries and materials. Practical implications - Optimisation of process parameters for the part geometry is a critical factor in improving dimensional accuracy and performance of SLM processes. Originality/value - This study demonstrates how application-tailored process parameters can lead to superior performance and improved dimensional accuracy. The results can be transferred to other lattice structure designs and materials.},

We demonstrate that by precisely designing the architecture of a lattice structure and implementing the accurate and cost-effective capabilities of polymer-based AM, it is possible to create lightweight and strong structures that are highly energy absorbing, able to recover their shape after extreme deformation, and have a high strength-over-weight ratio. Largescale AM lattices with various densities of unit cells were fabricated from two different polymers. The densities of the structures ranged from 66 kg/m3 to 192 kg/m3. Compression experiments established the scaling of their strength and stiffness with their relative density and revealed that the structures were able to recover their original shape after a compression up to 70{\%} strain. The energy absorption efficiency of the structures was 11{\%} higher than Duocel{\textregistered} aluminum foam and comparable to that of aluminum honeycomb, expanded polystyrene (EPS) foams, and Skydex twin hemispheres. These unconventional mechanical properties substantiate the potential of architectural design along with additive manufacturing in various applications, not only at laboratory scale, but also at industrial level.},

This paper presents an innovative path planning strategy using medial axis transformation for the wire-feed additive manufacturing process. The proposed path planning strategy is able to improve geometrical accuracy and produce void-free deposition by continuously altering the deposition width of the wire-feed process to accommodate the component geometry, while simultaneously minimising the number of interruptions to the deposition process at the component boundary. As a result, both buy-to-fly ratio and energy consumption are improved through reducing material waste. The algorithm for generating the adaptive path is described and validated through application to various typical geometries. Buy-to-fly ratios are calculated for a number of thin-walled complex structures. Savings of more than 27{\%} in material usage are achieved using adaptive path planning, when compared with non-adaptive methods. The proposed method is tested experimentally through deposition of two metal components. The results demonstrate that the adaptive strategy is capable of generating void-free deposition with improved accuracy at the component boundary using the wire-feed additive manufacturing process.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology to generate deposition paths for wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The medial axis transformation (MAT), which represents the skeleton of a given geometry, is firstly extracted to understand the geometry. Then a deposition path that is based on the MAT is efficiently generated. The resulting MAT-based path is able to entirely fill any given cross-sectional geometry without gaps. With the variation of step-over distance, material efficiency alters accordingly for both solid and thin-walled structures. It is found that thin-walled structures are more sensitive to step-over distance in terms of material efficiency. The optimal step-over distance corresponding to the maximum material efficiency can be achieved for various geometries, allowing the optimization of the deposition parameters. Five case studies of complex models including solid and thin-walled structures are used to test the developed methodology. Experimental comparison between the proposed MAT-based path patterns and the traditional contour path patterns demonstrate significant improved performance in terms of gap-free cross-sections. The proposed path planning strategy is shown to be particularly beneficial for WAAM of thin-walled structures.},

abstract = {Today's software for laser-based additive manufacturing compensates for the finite dimensions of the laser spot by insetting the contours of a solid part. However, features having smaller dimensions are removed by this operation, which may significantly alter the structure of thin-walled parts. To avoid potential production errors, this work describes in detail an algorithmic framework that makes beam compensation more reliable by computing laser scan paths for thin features. The geometry of the features can be adjusted by the scan paths by means of five intuitive parameters, which are illustrated with examples. Benchmarks show that the scan path generation comes at a reasonable cost without altering the computational complexity of the overall beam compensation framework. The framework was applied to Selective Laser Melting (SLM) to demonstrate that it can significantly improve the robustness of additive manufacturing. Besides robustness, the framework is expected to allow further improvements to the accuracy of additive manufacturing by enabling a geometry-dependent determination of the laser parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the field of bone defect repair, gradient porous scaffolds have received increased attention because they provide a better environment for promoting tissue regeneration. In this study, we propose an effective method to generate bionic porous scaffolds based on the TPMS (triply periodic minimal surface) and SF (sigmoid function) methods. First, cortical bone morphological features (e.g., pore size and distribution) were determined for several regions of a rabbit femoral bone by analyzing CT-scans. A finite element method was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the bone at these respective areas. These results were used to place different TPMS substructures into one scaffold domain with smooth transitions. The geometrical parameters of the scaffolds were optimized to match the elastic properties of a human bone. With this proposed method, a functional gradient porous scaffold could be designed and produced by an additive manufacturing method.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is the process of building three-dimensional solid shapes by accumulating material laid out in sectional layers. Additive manufacturing has been recognized for enabling production of complex custom parts that are difficult to manufacture otherwise. However, the dependence on build orientation and physical limitations of printing processes invariably lead to geometric deviations between manufactured and designed shapes that are usually evaluated after manufacture. In this paper, we formalize the measurement of such deviations in terms of a printability map that simulates the printing process and partitions each printed layer into disjoint regions with distinct local measures of size. We show that manufacturing capabilities, such as printing resolution, and material specific design recommendations, such as minimal feature sizes, may be coupled in the printability map to evaluate expected deviations before manufacture. Furthermore, we demonstrate how partitions with size measures below required resolutions may be modified using properties of the medial axis transform and use the corrected printability map to construct a representation of the manufactured model. We conclude by discussing several applications of the printability map for additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising alternative to traditional subtractive manufacturing for fabricating large aerospace components that feature high buy-to-fly ratio. Since the WAAM process builds up a part with complex geometry through the deposition of weld beads on a layer-by-layer basis, it is important to model the geometry of a single weld bead as well as the multi-bead overlapping process in order to achieve high surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the fabricated parts. This study firstly builds models for a single weld bead through various curve fitting methods. The experimental results show that both parabola and cosine functions accurately represent the bead profile. The overlapping principle is then detailed to model the geometry of multiple beads overlapping together. The tangent overlapping model (TOM) is established and the concept of the critical centre distance for stable multi-bead overlapping processes is presented. The proposed TOM is shown to provide a much better approximation to the experimental measurements when compared with the traditional flat-top overlapping model (FOM). This is critical in process planning to achieve better geometry accuracy and material efficiency in additive manufacturing.},

This study focuses on the development of an automated manufacturing system in order to free the operator from intervening in the analysis of the CAD model, planning the deposition path, and then manually setting the welding process parameters. Firstly, the relationship between single bead geometry and welding process parameters is established through an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Then, the adaptive medial axis transformation (MAT) algorithm for void-free deposition with high geometrical accuracy is introduced. The adaptive MAT path is implemented by using the single bead ANN model together with a previously developed multi-bead overlapping model. Finally, the adaptive MAT path planning strategy and the established bead models are tested through experimental deposition of two metal components. The results show that the developed bead model and adaptive MAT-based path are capable of producing depositions with high quality (void-free) and geometrical accuracy through automated selection of process variables for the WAAM process.},

abstract = {The build orientation is one the most influential factors on material properties in additively manufactured parts. Advanced applications, such as lattice structures optimized for lightweight, often rely on small safety margins and are, hence, particularly affected, but research has not gone far beyond the pure empirical characterization. The focus of this paper is to investigate in detail the influence of anisotropy induced through fabrication on the mechanical performance and build orientation of whole structures when subject to optimization. First, a material property model for both compression and tension states is formulated. Then, the Generalized Optimality Criteria method is extended for fixed topology lattice structures with respect to constraints in displacement, stress, and Euler buckling. The two latter are formulated as local constraints that are handled in combination with Fully-Stressed Design recursion. The results reveal significant safety threads likely leading to premature failure when using properties from one-directional tests, as is so far the case, rather than the full anisotropy model developed herein. If used inversely, the algorithm yields the optimal orientation of a structure on the build platform, allowing further weight reduction while maintaining the mechanical properties.},

abstract = {In additive manufacturing (AM), slicing is typically used to manufacture 3D models, one layer after another. Yet, in recent years quite a few hardware platforms were introduced toward the use of multi-axes AM with general 3D curves as print-paths. This paper presents algorithms for the generation of such general print-paths that can potentially be used to synthesize superior 3D models using AM. In slicing, a 3D model is decomposed into a series of parallel planar sections, which in turn are (usually) decomposed into a set of piecewise linear curves used as print-paths in the AM process. The methods we propose in this work ease this restriction, namely the print-paths are no longer limited to parallel planes. Like slicing, the methods we propose achieve a complete covering of a general volume with print-paths expressed as general curves. However, and unlike slicing, the created print-paths can conform better to the 3D model, its properties, and even user input. We expect that the added flexibility and freedom in the specification of AM print-paths, as opposed to limiting them to planar curves, will enable the synthesis of 3D models (using AM) with superior properties (such as mechanical strength and surface finish). As a proof of concept, we also present examples of 3D models manufactured with a low-end AM hardware and using the algorithms described in this paper.},

abstract = {Extrusion-based layered deposition is one of the widely used additive manufacturing (AM) technologies due to its flexibility and capability in producing prototypes without geometrical complexity limitations. One of the most important steps in determining the part quality and build time is the path planning, where the trajectory for guiding the extruder is defined by various aspects prior to actual deposition. In this paper, a novel methodology is presented to generate the deposition path for the extrusion-based AM of thin-walled parts, which is difficult to obtain desirable deposition quality using general filling paths. A wavy path pattern is adopted to fill the long and narrow cross-sections that are obtained from the slicing procedure of the thin-walled parts. This novel filling pattern can bring in better deposition results and has more excellence in enhancing the efficiency. The algorithms are proposed for the generation of wavy paths at first. Then, several implementations and optimisation methods are proposed to address some issues and extend its application. Finally, two cases are used to verify the developed methodology, and the comparison analysis demonstrates its evident advantages over traditional filling path in the fabrication efficiency for the extrusion-based additive fabrication of thin-walled objects. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

The tangential velocity along the path is smoothed and optimized while respecting the heater's and extruder's capacities, as well as the feed drives' jerk, acceleration and velocity limits. The extrusion rate is controlled proportional to the tangential path velocity while keeping the temperature of the deposited thermo-plastic material at the desired temperature by adaptively controlling current supply to the heater.

abstract = {This paper deals with the fast computation of straight skeletons of planar straight-line graphs (PSLGs) at an industrial-strength level. We discuss both the theoretical foun-dations of our algorithm and the engineering aspects of our implementation Bone. Our investigation starts with an analysis of the triangulation-based algorithm by Aichholzer and Aurenhammer and we prove the existence of flip-event-free Steiner triangulations. This result motivates a careful generalization of motorcycle graphs such that their inti-mate geometric connection to straight skeletons is maintained. Based on the generalized motorcycle graph, we devise a non-procedural characterization of straight skeletons of PSLGs and we discuss how to obtain a discretized version of a straight skeleton by means of graphics rendering. Most importantly, this generalization allows us to present a fast and easy-to-implement straight-skeleton algorithm. We implemented our algorithm in C ++ based on floating-point arithmetic. Extensive benchmarks with our code Bone demonstrate an O(n log n) time complexity and O(n) memory footprint on 22 300 datasets of diverse characteristics. This is a linear factor better than the implementation provided by CGAL 4.0, which shows an O(n 2 log n) time complexity and an O(n 2) memory footprint; the CGAL code has been the only fully-functional straight-skeleton code so far. In particular, on datasets with ten thousand vertices, Bone requires about 0.2–0.6 seconds instead of 4–7 minutes consumed by the CGAL code, and Bone uses only 20 MB heap memory instead of several gigabytes. We conclude our paper with a discussion of the engineering aspects and principles that make Bone reliable enough to compute the straight skeleton of datasets comprising a few million vertices on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {A robust and efficient algorithm for trimming both local and global self-intersections in offset curves and surfaces is presented. Our scheme is based on the derivation of a rational distance map between the original curve or surface and its offset. By solving a bivariate polynomial equation for an offset curve or a system of three polynomial equations for an offset surface, all local and global self-intersection regions in offset curves or surfaces can be detected. The zero-set of polynomial equation(s) corresponds to the self-intersection regions. These regions are trimmed by projecting the zero-set into an appropriate parameter space. The projection operation simplifies the analysis of the zero-set, which makes the proposed algorithm numerically stable and efficient. Furthermore, in a post-processing step, a numerical marching method is employed, which provides a highly precise scheme for self-intersection elimination in both offset curves and surfaces. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using several experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Exciting progress in additive manufacturing (AM) technology, which enables fabrication of cellular structures with highly complex lattices and pores, has stimulated the development of lightweight structural products with improved performance and increased functionality. However, conventional design and analysis tools lack the ability to optimize complex geometries efficiently and robustly. With this motivation, in this study, homogenized material models of open-cell polymeric foams with spherical cell architectures that are manufactured by using an AM technology are formulated through both experimental and numerical investigations, which in turn can be employed in a novel micromechanics based topology optimization algorithm developed for the optimization of cellular structures. In this regard, generating computer aided drawing (CAD) data, which is mandatory for AM, randomly intersected spherical ensemble method is employed. Several foam models with different porosities are generated, and utilized in nonlinear finite element analyses (FEAs) to determine constitutive elastic constants. Plastic stress-strain data for the bulk AM material are obtained through static tensile tests in a variety of different loading directions and these results used in FEA as true stress-strain data. Homogenization is performed based on a quadratic form of the widely used Gibson and Ashby foam model, which describes the Young's modulus E∗ and yield strength $\sigma$pl∗ of cellular structures in terms of relative density. Coefficients of the quadratic scaling laws are fitted by both FEA and experiments which are compared with each other.},

In this process a physical object is fabricated directly from a Computer-Aided Design model using layer-by-layer extrusion of a feedstock plastic filament material through a nozzle. It was originally developed for design and functional prototype applications but, in the last decade, gained considerable recognition and adoption in industry due to the process simplicity, affordability, and ability to make parts in a range of common engineering thermoplastics. Thus Fused Deposition Modeling products must comply with tolerance and roughness requirements in order to satisfy a mechanical coupling or functionality. This work strives to develop an integrated methodology able to help the process design with the aim to goal the requirements. This method allows knowing in advance the surface quality of the Fused Deposition Modeling product at chosen process parameters. This way an ex ante product check is possible. Moreover the methodology can find the set of solutions when the requirements are prescribed on the product features: it is possible to define the technology capability and analyze the proposed fabrication conditions. This methodology is highly useful in process management also in conjunction with other operations and can help the computer aided process planning since it can predict admissible scenarios.},

Finally, parametric analyses reveal influences of some key parameters on the local buckling stress and strength-to-density ratio; meanwhile the constitutive behaviors and energy-absorption properties, with increasing hierarchy n, are calculated.

abstract = {We investigated the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb structures using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. Hierarchical honeycombs were constructed by replacing every three-edge vertex of a regular hexagonal lattice with a smaller hexagon. Repeating this process builds a fractal-appearing structure. The resulting isotropic in-plane elastic properties (effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio) of this structure are controlled by the dimension ratios for different hierarchical orders. Hierarchical honeycombs of first and second order can be up to 2.0 and 3.5 times stiffer than regular honeycomb at the same mass (i.e., same overall average density). The Poisson's ratio varies from nearly 1.0 (when planar 'bulk' modulus is considerably greater than Young's modulus, so the structure acts 'incompressible' for most loadings) to 0.28, depending on the dimension ratios. The work provides insight into the role of structural organization and hierarchy in regulating the mechanical behavior of materials, and new opportunities for developing low-weight cellular structures with tailorable properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy absorption of honeycombs made of a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material with constant and functionally graded density were estimated up to large crushing strains. Our numerical simulations showed three distinct crushing modes for honeycombs with a constant relative density: quasi-static, transition and dynamic. Moreover, irregular cellular structures showed to have energy absorption similar to their counterpart regular honeycombs of same relative density and mass. To study the dynamic crushing of functionally graded cellular structures, a density gradient in the direction of crushing was introduced in the computational models by a gradual change of the cell wall thickness. Decreasing the relative density in the direction of crushing was shown to enhance the energy absorption of honeycombs at early stages of crushing. The study provides new insight into the behavior of engineered and biological cellular materials, and could be used to develop novel energy absorbent structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave ‘hanging' struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin' is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.},

abstract = {Fused filament fabrication of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) offers a capability to manufacture tailorable, flexible honeycomb structures which can be optimised for energy absorbing applications. This work explores the effect of a range of grading methodologies on the energy absorbing and damping behaviour of flexible TPU honeycomb structures. By applying density grading, the energy absorbing and damping profiles are significantly modified from the uniform density equivalent. A 3D-printing procedure was developed which allowed the manufacture of high-quality structures, which underwent cyclic loading to densification without failure. Graded honeycomb architectures had an average relative density of 0.375 ± 0.05. After quasi-static testing, arrays were subjected to sinusoidal compression over a range of amplitudes at 0.5 Hz. By grading the structural density in different ways, mechanical damping was modified. Cyclic compressive testing also showed how strain-softening of the TPU parent material could lead to reduced damping over the course of 50 cycles. Samples were subjected to impact loading at strain-rates of up to 51 s-1 and specific impact energies of up to 270 mJ/cm3. Lower peak loads were transferred for graded samples for the most severe impact cases. This behaviour reveals the potential of density grading of TPU structures to provide superior impact protection in extreme environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The mechanical properties at room temperature of three polymeric foams (namely EPP, PUR and PS/PA foams) have been experimentally evaluated in both static and impact loading conditions. The energy absorption characteristics have been examined both through the energy-absorption diagram method and through the efficiency diagram method. The meaning of the efficiency parameter, already used in the literature, has been explained in a proper, satisfactory way. It is shown that the maximum of the efficiency identifies the condition for optimal energy absorption of the foam, while the maximum stress reaches a value limited through other design considerations. The efficiency diagram method is then used to obtain synthetic diagrams useful to characterize the material and to help the design of energy absorbing components. These synthetic selection diagrams are obtained for the three tested materials. Finally, some consideration are drawn comparing the mechanical performance of the three considered types of foams and their dependency on density. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a "positive feedback loop" effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the "print-it-all" paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

abstract = {The present work describes an approach for layered manufacturing (LM) of porous objects using an appropriate modelling scheme, a pre-processing algorithm for slicing and a raster tool path generation based on the porosity information. Initially an overall framework of modelling and data transfer that includes controlled porosity information apart from the external geometry of porous objects and its transfer for LM is presented. A novel raster path generation methodology using space-filling fractal curves for LM of porous models is presented later. Specifically, the geometry and space-filling character-istics of fractal curves are studied for application to raster tool path generation in LM. Finally, boundary-constrained raster patterns are generated based on the surface geometry. The resulting data can be translated into a machine language file that can be imported by an LM system. Case studies are presented to illustrate the efficacy of this approach.},

abstract = {Several techniques exist to automatically synthesize a 2D image resembling an input exemplar texture. Most of the approaches op- timize a new image so that the color neighborhoods in the output closely match those in the input, across all scales. In this paper we revisit by-example texture synthesis in the context of additive man- ufacturing. Our goal is to generate not only colors, but also struc- ture along output surfaces: given an exemplar indicating 'solid' and 'empty' pixels, we generate a similar pattern along the output sur- face. The core challenge is to guarantee that the pattern is not only fully connected, but also structurally sound. To achieve this goal we propose a novel formulation for on-surface by-example texture synthesis that directly works in a voxel shell around the surface. It enables efficient local updates to the pattern, letting our structural optimizer perform changes that improve the overall rigidity of the pattern.We use this technique in an iterative scheme that jointly optimizes for appearance and structural sound- ness.We consider fabricability constraints and a user-provided de- scription of a force profile that the object has to resist. Our results fully exploit the capabilities of additive manufacturing by letting users design intricate structures along surfaces. The struc- tures are complex, yet they resemble input exemplars, resulting in a modeling tool accessible to casual users.},

abstract = {We develop a new kind of “space-filling” curves, connected Fer- mat spirals, and show their compelling properties as a tool path fill pattern for layered fabrication. Unlike classical space-filling curves such as the Peano or Hilbert curves, which constantly wind and bind to preserve locality, connected Fermat spirals are formed mostly by long, low-curvature paths. This geometric property, along with continuity, influences the quality and efficiency of layered fabrica- tion. Given a connected 2D region, we first decompose it into a set of sub-regions, each of which can be filled with a single continuous Fermat spiral. We show that it is always possible to start and end a Fermat spiral fill at approximately the same location on the outer boundary of the filled region. This special property allows the Fer- mat spiral fills to be joined systematically along a graph traversal of the decomposed sub-regions. The result is a globally continuous curve. We demonstrate that printing 2D layers following tool paths as connected Fermat spirals leads to efficient and quality fabrica- tion, compared to conventional fill patterns.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies require innovative design paradigms and guidelines that exhaust the offered freedoms in geometry and material. The aim of the Design for Additive Manufacturing is to provide design opportunities and to enhance workpiece properties taking into account constraints of the process, e.g. kinematics and limitations of print technology. Most AM applications are constrained to three-axis movements limiting the fabrication of workpieces layer by layer to one fixed building direction only. This causes limitations of strength properties, surface quality and the need of supporting structures. Multi-axis AM enables completely new design possibilities going beyond current optimization and design strategies of conventional AM workpieces. This innovation requires multiple design and manufacturing changes in the internal and external geometry of the workpiece as well as in machine and printing head technology. This paper identifies the requirements and capabilities of multi-axis AM and presents possible solutions to overcome the identified challenges. Preliminary results for multi-axis AM are described on an exemplary workpiece.},

@article{Johnson2018,
abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) professionals often throw around the notion that complexity is free. Indeed, complexity is much easier and potentially cheaper to achieve through AM than through traditional manufacturing, but it is not free. Upon attempting to manufacture complex designs, it is quickly found that certain features, or topologies, are more manufacturable than others, with sacrificial support material required for many complex designs. This will significantly increase machining costs. Topology Optimization (TO) is a freeform computational design methodology which is ideal for designing lightweight structures through a combination of modeling and rigorous optimization. While AM can realize many complex topologies, there still remain AM manufacturing limitations (such as overhangs), which require customized TO design algorithms beyond freeform TO. In this work, a projection-based TO methodology is presented to design for 3D self-supporting structures – i.e. structures that do not require sacrificial support material. The foundation of the presented methodology is a 2D overhang projection framework. In addition to expanding the methodology to three dimensions, the algorithm is drastically improved through (1) adopting a new overhang mapping scheme which allows for exact specification of allowable overhang angle, and (2) implementing an adjoint approach to sensitivity calculations to speed up calculation drastically and to allow for scalability. Using several examples, it is shown that the presented methodology generates self-supporting structures (given a prescribed printable overhang angle) which are entirely manufacturable without any added sacrificial support material. Upon printing a couple topologies with mixed success, further customization of the algorithm is proposed for situations where multiple directional-dependent overhang angles are possible in a single AM system.},

abstract = {Lattice structures with different desired physical properties are promising for a broad spectrum of applications. The availability of additive manufacturing (AM) technology has relaxed the fabricating limitation of lattice structures. However, manufacturing constraints still exist for AM-fabricated lattice structures, which have a significant influence on the printing quality and mechanical properties of lattice struts. In this paper, a design and optimization strategy is proposed for lattice structures with the consideration of manufacturability to ensure desired printing quality. The concept of manufacturable element is used to link the design and manufacturing process. A meta-model is constructed by experiments and the artificial neural network to obtain the manufacturing constraints. Sizes of struts are optimized by a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization-based algorithm with these manufacturing constraints. An arm of quadcopter is redesigned and optimized to validate the proposed method. Its result shows that optimized heterogeneous lattice structures can improve the stiffness of the model compared to the homogeneous lattice structure and the original design. Both the Von-Mises stress and the maximum displacement are reduced without increasing the weight of designed part. And by considering the manufacturability constraints, the optimized design has been successfully fabricated by the selected additive manufacturing process.},

However, for life-like reproduction of the material appearance of such paintings, the typical gloss and translucency must also be included, which is currently not the case. The aim of this paper is to elaborate on the challenges and results of capturing and reproducing oil paint gloss (next to texture and color) using a scanning and printing system. A sample was hand-made using oil paint and acrylic varnish, and its gloss was then reproduced. A gloss map of the painted sample was acquired using a high end DLSR camera and a simple acquisition protocol. Next, Oc{\'{e}} High Resolution 3D printing technology was used to create samples with spatially varying gloss. For this, two different strategies were combined: (1) multilevel half-toning of the colors was used to reproduce matte color layers, and (2) varnish was half-toned on top in increasing coverage to recreate increasing gloss levels. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art literature in gloss reproduction and perception, our process of reproduction as well as the visual evaluation of the quality of the created reproduction.},

abstract = {Man and nature both exploit the remarkable properties of cellular solids, by which we mean foams, meshes and microlattices. To the non-scientist, their image is that of soft, compliant, things: cushions, packaging and padding. To the food scientist they are familiar as bread, cake and desserts of the best kind: meringue, mousse and sponge. To those who study nature they are the structural materials of their subject: wood, coral, cancellous bone. And to the engineer they are of vast importance in building lightweight structures, for energy management, for thermal insulation, filtration and much more. When a solid is converted into a material with a foam-like structure, the single-valued properties of the solid are extended. By properties we mean stiffness, strength, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, electrical resistivity and so forth. And the extension is vast-the properties can be changed by a factor of 1000 or more. Perhaps the most important concept in analysing the mechanical behaviour is that of the distinction between a stretch- and a bending-dominated structure. The first is exceptionally stiff and strong for a given mass; the second is compliant and, although not strong, it absorbs energy well when compressed. This paper summarizes a little of the way in which the mechanical properties of cellular solids are analysed and illustrates the range of properties offered by alternative configurations.},

In this study, additive manufacturing and topology optimization are combined for designing Face Centre Cube (FCC), Vertex Cube (VC), and Edge Centre Cube (ECC) structures, which are manufactured via SLM technology. Mechanical performance is evaluated, and a Gibson-Ashby model is developed to predict the performance of the three structures including different levels of porosity. The results show that FCC and VC lattice structures have better mechanical behaviour compared with that of the ECC lattice structure; however, their energy absorption efficiency is inferior to that of the ECC lattice structure. Comparisons between various SLM built lattice structures made from 316L stainless steel prove that the performance of topology-optimized lattice structures is superior to the majority of lattice structures. This result verifies the feasibility of lattice structure unit selection via topology optimization technology. Various work conditions are simulated for topology optimization to obtain a lightweight lattice structure with optimal performance under specific conditions.},

This paper provides a critical review on the state-of-the-art advances in the design of periodic microstructures of multi-functional materials for a range of physical properties, such as elastic stiffness, Poisson's ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, conductivity, fluidic permeability, particle diffusivity, electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability, etc.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3 dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality criteria method. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible to design materials with many different properties using base cells modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate the expected behaviour. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Using a single, relatively stiff printer material, our method designs an assembly of small- scale microstructures that have the effect of a softer material at the object scale, with properties depending on the microstructure used in each part of the object. We build on work in the area of meta- materials, using numerical optimization to design tiled microstruc- tures with desired properties, but with the key difference that our method designs families of related structures that can be interpo- lated to smoothly vary the material properties over a wide range. To create an object with spatially varying elastic properties, we tile the object's interior with microstructures drawn from these families, generating a different microstructure for each cell using an efficient algorithm to select compatible structures for neighboring cells. We show results computed for both 2D and 3D objects, validating sev- eral 2D and 3D printed structures using standard material tests as well as demonstrating various example applications.},

abstract = {The viability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) as an Additive Manufacturing (AM) method is improved by including discrete carbon fibers in the polymer feedstock. The resulting carbon fiber polymer composite enhances mechanical and thermal properties, where improvements are directly related to the orientation of the carbon fibers within the extruded polymer composite. Fiber orientation in the polymer melt is affected by the flow field which is defined by the melt flow geometry including flow in the nozzle convergence and extrudate swell. This paper presents a computational approach for modeling the polymer melt flow and the associated effects of nozzle geometry and extrudate swell on fiber orientation in the extruded polymer. The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow in the axisymmetric flow field of an FFF nozzle. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Orthotropic Fitted Closure and the Folgar-Tucker isotropic fiber interaction model. The radial and axial modulus of the extruded polymer is then calculated from fiber orientation tensors within the composite at the nozzle exit. Fiber orientation along the extrudate axis is shown to increase due to elongation flow within the nozzle convergence zone and decrease in the extrudate swell such that the modulus of elasticity of the extruded polymer is moderately affected by extrudate swell and substantially affected by the nozzle geometry.},

abstract = {This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into 3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful formalism developed in this work.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies fabricate objects layer by layer, adding material on top of already solidified layers. A key challenge is to ensure that there is always something below the layer being fabricated: otherwise added material simply falls under the effect of gravity -- this is a critical issue with most technologies. 

This difficulty is typically treated differently for the interior and the exterior of an object: the exterior is supported through structures akin to scaffoldings that are removed afterwards, while the interior volume is filled with a sparse, self-supporting infill pattern. The infill acts as a support for the tops and also provides mechanical strength to the final print. However, as objects grow in size even sparse infills become prohibitively expensive in time and material usage, and if made too sparse they no longer provide the required support. This prevents printing large objects with empty interiors.

In this work we investigate how to compute as large as possible self-supporting empty cavities. Our technique is based on an iterated geometric carving algorithm, that is fast to compute and produces nested sets of inner walls. The walls have exactly the minimal printable thickness of the manufacturing process everywhere. Remarkably, our technique only manipulates two consecutive slices of the model at a time, sweeping through the model along the vertical direction, from top to bottom. 

We discuss an efficient, robust implementation in details, based on a filtered polygonal medial axis extraction and an exact polygon offsetting technique. 
Using our approach, we can print large parts on filament printers using as little as a single filament thickness, providing on order of magnitude reduction in print time and material use while $\backslash$textit{\{}guaranteeing{\}} printability.},

abstract = {Layered manufacturing inherently suffers from staircase defects along surfaces that are gently slopped with respect to the build direction. Reducing the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions. In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works with standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely available 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness. Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply and analyze our approach on 3D printed examples, showing that our technique greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the print time nearly identical.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a process by which a three dimensional object is 
created layer after layer, through selective deposition of material.
It often requires the automated generation of auxiliary shapes, to temporarily 
support the object, to protect its surface, or to carve inner cavities and 
reduce material usage.

In this context, we define a ``printable enclosure'' as a minimal volume
enclosing a given shape and whose boundary can be printed at the smallest 
possible thickness while ensuring proper bonding between layers.
Such an enclosure is well suited to serve as auxiliary structure for additive 
manufacturing: it is easy to print and require little material. In this
paper, we demonstrate its use on three different applications: enclosing a
print within protective walls that are close to the surface; generating large
inner cavities whose walls are printable, and finally modeling support 
structures that provide a dense support to the downward facing surfaces while 
vanishing as quickly as possible below the supported object.

We obtain the shape of an enclosure by considering constraints on its set of slices along 
horizontal planes. In practice, the set of slices is discrete and the 
constraints afford for an efficient sweep-like construction algorithm using 
morphological operations on the slices. We discuss the printability and 
optimality of the enclosures and their boundary walls.},

abstract = {Decorative patterns are observed in many forms of art, typically enriching the visual aspect of otherwise simple shapes. Such patterns are especially difficult to create, as they often exhibit intricate structural details and at the same time have to precisely match the size and shape of the underlying geometry. In the field of Computer Graphics, several approaches have been proposed to automatically synthesize a decorative pattern along a curve, from an example. This empowers non expert users with a simple brush metaphor, allowing them to easily paint complex structured decorations.

We extend this idea to the space of design and fabrication. The major challenge is to properly account for the topology of the produced patterns. In particular, our technique ensures that synthesized patterns will be made of exactly one connected component, so that once printed they form a single object. To achieve this goal we propose a two steps synthesis process, first synthesizing the topology of the pattern and later synthesizing its exact geometry. We introduce topology descriptors that efficiently capture the topology of the pattern synthesized so far.

We propose several applications of our method, from designing objects using synthesized patterns along curves and within rectangles, to the decoration of surfaces with a dedicated smooth frame interpolation. Using our technique, designers paint structured patterns that can be fabricated into solid, tangible objects, creating unusual and surprising designs of lamps, chairs and laces from examples.},

abstract = {We propose an optimization framework for 3D printing that seeks to save printing time and the support material required to print 3D shapes. Three-dimensional printing technology is rapidly maturing and may revolutionize how we manufacture objects. The total cost of printing, however, is governed by numerous factors which include not only the price of the printer but also the amount of material and time to fabricate the shape. Our PackMerger framework converts the input 3D watertight mesh into a shell by hollowing its inner parts. The shell is then divided into segments. The location of splits is controlled based on several parameters, including the size of the connection areas or volume of each segment. The pieces are then tightly packed using optimization. The optimization attempts to minimize the amount of support material and the bounding box volume of the packed segments while keeping the number of segments minimal. The final packed configuration can be printed with substantial time and material savings, while also allowing printing of objects that would not fit into the printer volume. We have tested our system on three different printers and it shows a reduction of 5-30{\%} of the printing time while simultaneously saving 15-65{\%} of the support material. The optimization time was approximately 1 min. Once the segments are printed, they need to be assembled.},

abstract = {Many displays are basically bilevel in nature with individual display cells, all of the same size, arranged in a rectangular array. We present a survey of processing techniques for presenting continuous tone still images on such displays. Four techniques are covered in detail while several others are covered briefly. All the techniques achieve the subjective effect of continuous tone by properly controlling only the spatial density of bilevel display states. The processing techniques consist of dividing an image into picture elements and comparing the intensity of each element with a threshold value. If the element intensity is greater than the threshold, the corresponding display cell is set to the bright state; otherwise, the cell is set to the dark state. In the ordered-dither technique, the threshold is spatially dependent, i.e., it is determined only by the coordinates of the element being processed. In the remaining three techniques, constrained average, dynamic threshold, and minimized average error, the threshold is determined by values of elements close to the one currently being processed. The latter three thus require more processing and more storage than the first, but allow some edge emphasis. Images processed by all the described techniques are exhibited. {\textcopyright} 1976 Academic Press, Inc.},

With these operations, we show that (1) exhaustive search in the BSP tree ---the most time-consuming step in Chopper ---can be avoided, (2) more flexible geometric configurations can be provided, (3) user's design intention is considered naturally and efficiently, and customized 3D partitioning results can be obtained.

We have validated our material measure- ment process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization pro- cess that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd This work presents a halftoning technique to manufacture 3D objects with the appearance of continuous grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous paths. The line-based halftoning principle called ‘hatching' is applied to the line patterns naturally occurring in FDM prints, which are built up in a layer-by-layer fashion. The proposed halftoning technique is not limited by the challenges existing techniques face; existing FDM coloring techniques greatly influence the surface geometry and deteriorate with surface slopes deviating from vertical or greatly influence the basic parameters of the printing process and thereby the structural properties of the resulting product. Furthermore, the proposed technique has little effect on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results. Future work is required to calibrate the perceived tone.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by the undesirable fabricating efficiency, which has attracted attentions from a wide range of areas, such as fabrication method, material improvement, and algorithm optimization. As a critical step in the process planning of additive manufacturing, path planning plays a significant role in affecting the build time by means of determining the paths for the printing head's movement. So a novel path filling pattern for the deposition of extrusion–based additive manufacturing is developed in this paper, mainly to avoid the retraction during the deposition process, and hence the time moving along these retracting paths can be saved and the discontinuous deposition can be avoided as well. On the basis of analysis and discussion of the reason behind the occurrence of retraction in the deposition process, a path planning strategy called “go and back” is presented to avoid the retraction issue. The “go and back” strategy can be adopted to generate a continuous extruder path for simple areas with the start point being connected to the end point. So a sliced layer can be decomposed into several simple areas and the sub-paths for each area are generated based on the proposed strategy. All of these obtainable sub-paths can be connected into a continuous path with proper selection of the start point. By doing this, separated sub-paths are joined with each other to decrease the number of the startup and shutdown process for the extruder, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the deposition quality and the efficiency. Additionally, some methodologies are proposed to further optimize the generated non-retraction paths. At last, several cases are used to test and verify the developed methodology and the comparisons with conventional path filling patterns are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the retraction motions and is especially beneficial for the high efficient additive manufacturing without compromise on the part resistance.},

abstract = {The use of space filling curves for proximity-improving mappings is well known and has found many useful applications in parallel computing. Such curves permit a linear array to be mapped onto a 2D (respectively, 3D) structure such that points that are distance d apart in the linear array are distance O(d(1/2)) (O(d(1/3))) apart in the 2D (3D) array and vice versa. We extend the concept of space filling curves to space filling surfaces and show how these surfaces lead to mappings from 2D to 3D so that points at distance d 1 2 on the 2D surface are mapped to points at distance O(d(1/3)) in the 3D volume. Three classes of surfaces, associated respectively with the Peano curve, Sierpinski carpet, and the Hilbert curve, are presented. A methodology for using these surfaces to map from 2D to 3D is developed. These results permit efficient execution of 2D computations on processors interconnected in a 3D grid. The space filling surfaces proposed by us are the first such fractal objects to be formally defined and are thus also of intrinsic interest in the context of fractal geometry.},

The boundaries of the sub-regions are extracted as the feature lines of the image. Next, a proper number of points are randomly placed on the image plane with a density proportional to the darkness of the image. We use Lloyd's method to push the sampling points away from each other and the feature lines. The points within each sub-region are then connected by solving a travelling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, we further optimize the fairness and the spacing of the lines by minimizing a tailored objective function. A variety of experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method for generating line drawings for 3D printing.},

abstract = {An {\$}r{\$}-gentiling is a dissection of a shape into {\$}r \backslashgeq 2{\$} parts which are all similar to the original shape. An {\$}r{\$}-reptiling is an {\$}r{\$}-gentiling of which all parts are mutually congruent. By applying gentilings recursively, together with a rule that defines an order on the parts, one may obtain an order in which to traverse all points within the original shape. We say such a traversal is a face-continuous space-filling curve if, at any level of recursion, the interior of the union of any set of consecutive parts is connected---that is, consecutive parts must always meet along an edge. Most famously, the isosceles right triangle admits a 2-reptiling, which forms the basis of the face-continuous Sierpinski space-filling curve; many other right triangles admit reptilings and gentilings that yield face-continuous space-filling curves as well. In this study we investigate what acute triangles admit non-trivial reptilings and gentilings, and whether these can form the basis for face-continuous space-filling curves. We derive several properties of reptilings and gentilings of acute (sometimes also obtuse) triangles, leading to the following conclusion: no face-continuous space-filling curve can be constructed on the basis of reptilings of acute triangles.},

abstract = {An effective method for the 3D porous scaffold design of human tissue is presented based on a hybrid method of distance field and triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS). By the creative application of traditional distance field algorithm into the Boolean operations of the anatomical model and TPMS-based unit cell library, an almost defects free porous scaffolds having the complicated micro-structure and high quality external surface faithful to a specific anatomic model can be easily obtained without the difficult and time-consuming trimming and re-meshing processes. After generating the distance fields for the given tissue model and required internal micro-structure, a series of simple modifications in distance fields enable us to obtain a complex porous scaffold. Experimental results show that the proposed scaffold design method has the potential to combine the perfectly interconnected pore networks based on the TPMS unit cell libraries and the given external geometry in a consistent framework irrespective of the complexity of the models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel two-scale framework to optimize the structure and the material distribution of an object given its functional specifications. Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut -- the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set field. Next, we propose an efficient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially-varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially-varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties in order to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by designing, optimizing, and fabricating objects in different material property spaces on the level of a trillion voxels, i.e several orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with current systems.},

abstract = {Figure 1: Our method procedurally generates structures with graded material elasticities, which can be directly fabricated. Here the user paints elasticity on a 3D model to create a flexible figurine. Model: Moomin (thing:1173447) by Jeroentjj. Abstract Microstructures at the scale of tens of microns change the physical properties of objects, making them lighter or more flexible. While traditionally difficult to produce, additive manufacturing now lets us physically realize such microstruc-tures at low cost. In this paper we propose to study procedural, aperiodic microstructures inspired by Voronoi open-cell foams. The absence of regularity affords for a simple approach to grade the foam geometry — and thus its mechanical properties — within a target object and its surface. Rather than requiring a global optimization process, the microstructures are di-rectly generated to exhibit a specified elastic behavior. The implicit evaluation is akin to procedural textures in com-puter graphics, and locally adapts to follow the elasticity field. This allows very detailed structures to be generated in large objects without having to explicitly produce a full representation — mesh or voxels — of the complete object: the structures are added on the fly, just before each object slice is manufactured. We study the elastic behavior of the microstructures and pro-vide a complete description of the procedure generating them. We explain how to determine the geometric parameters of the microstructures from a target elasticity, and evaluate the result on printed samples. Finally, we apply our approach to the fabrication of objects with spatially varying elasticity, in-cluding the implicit modeling of a frame following the object surface and seamlessly connecting to the microstructures.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach for designing functional mate- rial definitions for multi-material fabrication using our system called Foundry. Foundry provides an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The result- ing meta-materials exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The operators are imple- mented using a domain-specific language for multi-material fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators. Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized, resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction with progressive refinement, allows for interac- tive material evaluation even for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with our system.},

This STAR examines recent systems devel-oped by the computer graphics community in which designers specify higher-level goals ranging from structural integrity and deformation to appearance and aesthetics, with the final detailed shape and manufacturing instructions emerging as the result of computation. It summarizes frameworks for interaction, simulation, and optimization, as well as documents the range of general objectives and domain-specific goals that have been considered. An important unifying thread in this analysis is that different underlying geometric and physical representations are necessary for different tasks: we document over a dozen classes of representations that have been used for fabrication-aware design in the literature. We analyze how these classes possess obvious advantages for some needs, but have also been used in creative manners to facilitate unexpected problem solutions.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is finding renewed interest thanks to additive manufacturing-a technology that is well-suited to fabricate the complex organic shapes and structures that often arise from topology optimization. This paper reviews the current state of topology optimization software through the redesign of a real aerospace mounting plate, focusing on manufacturing considerations that are important for additive manufacturing (AM). Twenty different commercial and educational software tools are investigated and categorized based on their capabilities. Two representative software tools are then demonstrated with well-known examples to compare user interfaces and outputs, and one is chosen to perform the mounting plate case study. We find that all of the commercially available topology optimization software packages offer similar capabilities and considerably more functionality than educational software, but only a few niche products can be tailored to specific applications and manufacturing processes. Current commercial software does not provide adequate manufacturing constraints to remove the need for manual interpretation of results for additive manufacture. A case study involving optimization of an industry-relevant component for AM is used to provide in-depth understanding of both topology optimization and manufacturing considerations in AM. Shortcomings in the existing software tools are presented, and future requirements to take advantage of the increasing AM capabilities, particularly in metals, are discussed. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 by ASME.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing methods provide an increasingly popular industrial means of producing complex mechanical parts when classical methods are not suitable. The main advantage of these methods is the great freedom they give designers. At the same time, theoretical and numerical topology optimization tools can be used to simulate structures with complex shapes which exactly meet the mechanical constraints while requiring as little material as possible. Combining topology optimization and additive production procedures therefore seems to be a promising approach for obtaining optimized mechanical parts. Nonetheless structures obtained via topology optimization are composed of parts of composite densities which can not produced via additive manufacturing. Only numerical structures made of full or empty spaces only can be produced by additive methods. This can be obtained at the end of computational optimization through a penalization step which gives the composite densities from 0 to 1 the values 0 or 1. This means that the final part is different from the best solution predicted by topology optimization calculations. It therefore seemed to be worth checking the validity of an engineering approach in which additive methods are used to manufacture structures based on the use of industrial topology optimization codes. Here the authors propose to study, in the case of a simple mechanical problem, that of a metal cube subjected to a given pressure, three procedures, which differed in terms of the code and type of topology optimization calculations performed and the level of penalization applied. The three structures thus obtained were then produced using additive methods. Since all three structures proved to be mechanically resistant, the three procedures used can be said to be valid. However, one of them yielded better compromise between the mechanical strength and the amount of material saved.},

abstract = {An algorithm for generating a toolpath for a milling machine is described. The approach to its design was interdisciplinary. The algorithm contains ideas from computer graphics and mathematics, rather than mechanical engineering alone. An artefact described by any set of curved surfaces is carved out of a workpiece in two stages. Horizontal slices are removed to reveal the roughly cut artefact, and a final pass cuts the artefact to within a preset tolerance. The toolpath might seem to be needlessly convoluted, but it has substantial advantages over less sophisticated paths. Its local complexity adapts automatically to the local complexity of the artefact, so that more attention is concentrated on those parts of the artefact which require it. At the roughing out stage, the path efficiently skips over completely worked areas without retracing them with each new horizontal slice. The path minimizes the amount of tool movement which does not cut material, and minimizes the number of occassions on which the tool reenters the material. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate that the new approach is viable. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.This paper is focused on finding the efficient path generating algorithms. These algorithms can take part in the path planning process, which is the last stage in model processing for 3D printing. The paper provides the comparative analysis of the five implemented path generating algorithms, which are based on four strategies: ZigZag strategy, Contour strategy, Spiral Strategy, and Fractal strategy. The analysis is based on the results of experiments made with the designed and implemented experimentation system. The system allows carrying out two types of experiments: simulation experiments and physical one. The simulation experiment is performed with the programming application written in C{\#}. The physical experiments utilized FDM technology for 3D printing. Basing on the obtained results, we can conclude that the algorithm based on the ZigZag strategy seems to be better than the algorithms based on other approaches.},

abstract = {Hierarchical structures, also known as fractal structures, exhibit advantageous material properties, such as water- and oil-repellency as well as other useful optical characteristics, owing to its self similarity. Various methods have been developed for producing hierarchical geometrical structures. Recently, fractal structures have been manufactured using a 3D printing technique that involves computer aided design data. In this study, we confirmed the accuracy of geometrical structures when Koch curve-like fractal structures with zero to three generations were printed using a 3D printer. The fractal dimension was analyzed using a box-counting method. This analysis indicated that the fractal dimension of the third generation hierarchical structure was approximately the same as that of the ideal Koch curve. These findings demonstrate that the design and production of fractal structures can be controlled using a 3D printer. Although the interior angle deviated from the ideal value, the side length could be precisely controlled. {\textcopyright} 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.},

abstract = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is one of the most widespread additive manufacturing technique used for fabricating 3D objects without any design constraints. It is a solid-based process in which polymers material in the form of semi molten state is extruded from the nozzle to fabricate the 3D objects. In the present work, a new tool path strategy for FDM process has been developed based on Hilbert curve. Hilbert curve is a space filling fractal curve and its hausdorff dimension is two. This curve is surjective and continuous in nature. The proposed tool path from developed program are validated though simulation and experimental results. The new approach has been simulated using MATLAB computing platform. Boolean operators like intersection and subtraction are utilized for finding the intersection points for the tool path generation. A self-developed extruder system based on screw extrusion is used for the real time application of the algorithm developed. The extruder head is reconfigured to an existing CNC milling machine for printing and production purpose. Case study for different types of prototypes are also presented to demonstrate the capabilities of developed tool path algorithm.},

abstract = {Purpose In Additive manufacturing process, the physical properties of the products made by fractal toolpaths are better as compared to those made by conventional toolpaths. Also it is desirable to minimise the number of tool retractions. This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. Design/methodology/approach This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. In first method a large fractal square is placed over the outer boundary and then rest of the unwanted curve is trimmed out. To reduce the number of retractions, ends of the trimmed toolpath are connected in such a way that overlapping within the existing toolpath is avoided. In second method the trimming of the fractal is similar to the first method but the ends of trimmed toolpath are connected such that the overlapping is found at the boundaries only. The toolpath in third method is a combination of fractal and zigzag curves. This toolpath is capable of filling a given connected area in a single pass without any tool retraction and toolpath overlap within a tolerance value equal to stepover of the toolpath. Findings The generated toolpath has several applications in Additive Manufacturing and constant Z-height surface finishing. Experiments have been performed to verify the toolpath by depositing material by Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process. Research limitations/implications Third toolpath method is suitable for the Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process only because the toolpath overlapping tolerance may not be enough for other Additive Manufacturing processes. Originality/value Development of a CNC toolpath for Additive Manufacturing Specifically Hybrid Layered Manufacturing which can completely fill any arbitrary connected area in single pass while maintaining a constant stepover.},

Recently domain decomposition and space filling curves have been introduced for slice generation in FDM [1]. The current work focuses on the implementations of fractal-like buildstyle patterns using Simulated Annealing [2, 3], Lin-Kernighan algorithms [4] and Construction Procedures based on Nearest Neighbor Heuristics [5]. These computational optimization procedures are able to generate filling patterns that allow the continuous deposition of a single road to fill arbitrary shaped domains. The necessary software modules to produce arbitrary three-dimensional artifacts have been developed and are evaluated with respect to part quality and build time.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the issues and opportunities for the application of topology optimization methods for additive manufacturing (AM). The main analysis issues discussed are: how to achieve the maximum geometric resolution to allow the fine features easily manufacturable by AM to be represented in the optimization model; the manufacturing constraints to be considered, and the workflow modifications required to handle the geometric complexity in the post optimization stages. The main manufacturing issues discussed are the potential for realizing intermediate density regions, in the case of the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach, the use of small scale lattice structures, the use of multiple material AM processes, and an approach to including support structure requirement as a manufacturing constraint.

abstract = {Rapid prototyping (RP) and more generally Additive Manufacturing (AM) enable the manufacture of complex geometries, which are very difficult to build with classical production. There are numerous technologies that are using different kind of material. For each of these, there are at least two materials: the production material and the support one. Support material is, in most cases, cleaned and becomes a manufacturing residue. Improve the material volume and the global mass of the product is an essential aim surrounding the integration of simulation in additive manufacturing process. Moreover the layer-by-layer technology of additive manufacturing allows the design of innovative objects and the use of topological optimization in this context can create a very interesting combination. The purpose of our paper is to present a methodology and a tool, which allow the use of topological optimization for the preparation of model for RP and AM.},

abstract = {Composite finite elements (CFEs) based on a hexahedral discretization of
the simulation domain have recently shown their effectiveness in
physically based simulation of deformable bodies with changing topology.
In this paper we present an efficient collision detection method for CFE
simulation of cuts. Our method exploits the specific characteristics of
CFEs, i.e., the fact that the number of simulation degrees of freedom is
significantly reduced. We show that this feature not only leads to a
faster deformation simulation, but also enables a faster collision
detection. To address the non-conforming properties of geometric
composition and hexahedral discretization, we propose a topology-aware
interpolation approach for the computation of penetration depth. We show
that this approach leads to accurate collision detection on complex
boundaries. Our results demonstrate that by using our method cutting on
high-resolution deformable bodies including collision detection and
response can be performed at interactive rates.},

research topic in physically based modelling and simulation for more

and efficient incorporation of cuts into an accurate computational model

presents a coherent summary of the state of the art in virtual cutting
of deformable bodies, focusing on the distinct geometrical and
topological representations of the deformable body, as well as the
specific numerical discretizations of the governing equations of motion.
In particular, we discuss virtual cutting based on tetrahedral,
hexahedral and polyhedral meshes, in combination with standard,
polyhedral, composite and extended finite element discretizations. A
separate section is devoted to meshfree methods. Furthermore, we discuss
cutting-related research problems such as collision detection and haptic
rendering in the context of interactive cutting scenarios. The report is
complemented with an application study to assess the performance of
virtual cutting simulators.},

abstract = {Rigid body contact with multiple regions is common in virtual
environments. The traditional penalty based haptic display treats
translational penetration depth at each contact region independently,
and hence causes the undesired effect of visual interpenetration since
it does not guarantee all geometrical constraints simultaneously. It may
also introduce force discontinuity due to the singularity of penetration
depth. To overcome these artifacts, we present a method based on the
concept of generalized penetration depth (GPD), which considers both
translation and rotation to separate two overlapping objects. The method
could be viewed as an extension of the classic god-object method from
Euclidean space to configuration space in which GPD is defined. We
demonstrate the method for 3-DoF rigid bodies using pre-computed contact
space. For 6-DoF rigid bodies where pre-computation is not feasible, we
propose an efficient method to approximate the local contact space based
on continuous collision detection and quadratic programming.},

abstract = {A key requirement in 3D fabrication is to generate objects with individual exterior shapes and their interior being optimized to application-specific force constraints and low material consumption. Accomplishing this task is challenging on desktop computers, due to the extreme model resolutions that are required to accurately predict the physical shape properties, requiring memory and computational capacities going beyond what is currently available. Moreover, fabrication-specific constraints need to be considered to enable printability. To address these challenges, we present a scalable system for generating 3D objects using topology optimization, which allows to efficiently evolve the topology of high-resolution solids towards printable and light-weight-high-resistance structures. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a high-performance GPU solver which can efficiently handle models comprising several millions of elements. A minimum thickness constraint is built into the optimization process to automatically enforce printability of the resulting shapes. We further shed light on the question how to incorporate geometric shape constraints, such as symmetry and pattern repetition, in the optimization process. We analyze the performance of the system and demonstrate its potential by a variety of different shapes such as interior structures within closed surfaces, exposed support structures, and surface models.},

abstract = {The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle deformation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand animation. We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those created manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture system to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art-directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},
