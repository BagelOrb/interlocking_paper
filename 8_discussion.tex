\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Model and simulation accuracy}
ana optimum wrt FEM optimum wrt print results

print results dont disprove models?


\subsection{Comparison of interlocking structures}

achieved strength; compared to theoretical max

broken optimum seems to perform a lot better than expected

only some designs performed worse significantly

on par with jigsaw, but that one violated the $\lmax$ constraint

show optimal designs


\subsection{Limitations}
Causes for Standard deviation: manufacturing inaccuracies due to location on print bed, filament diameter, temperature oscillations

Boundary cells of interlocking structure: 12/25, weird geometry

Different number of cells
