\subsection{Related Work}\label{interlocking:sec:related_work}

\paragraph{Multi-material additive manufacturing}
Multi-material additive manufacturing has unlocked a plethora of applications, by making use of functionally graded material properties, tailored composite materials or multi-material designs.
Several review papers cover a wide range of techniques on these topics.\cite{Vaezi2013,Rafiee2020}
Using multiple materials to create coloured surface imagery is commonly performed using MultiJet technologies, but can alternatively be performed using inkjet techniques\cite{sachs1994three} or even DLP resin printers \cite{Zhou2011Development}.
Such techniques can even be extended to deal with translucency\cite{Brunton2018} and gloss\cite{elkhuizen2019gloss}.
Several colour printing techniques have also been proposed for \revise{FDM}{MEX}.\cite{reiner2014dual,Song2019,Kuipers2018}

Besides visual attributes, multi-material systems can be used to create parts with graded material properties, by generating composite structures with varying densities of soft and hard materials.\cite{Cho2003851}
Fine-tuning the small-scale geometry in which such materials are deposited can give a more sophisticated control over the induced material properties,\cite{Leung2019,mirzaali2020}
and adjusting the small-scale geometry throughout the product on a \revise{mesa}{meso} scale can increase the performance of the product even more.\cite{Zhu2017}

Some \revise{FDM}{MEX} systems for multi-material extrusion have been proposed which operate by extruding multiple materials out of a single nozzle, e.g. by routing multiple filaments into a single mixing nozzle\cite{diamondhotend} or by creating a single strand of multi-material filament\cite{Takahashi2020,Mosaic2015},
but such systems can exhibit hardware issues when the different materials require vastly different processing parameters.
Therefore the more upscale multi-material extrusion systems use a separate nozzle for each material.\cite{UltimakerS5}

\paragraph{\revise{Microstructure}{Lattice}s}
% multi-material \revise{microstructure}{lattice}s
\revise{Microstructure}{Lattice}s such as beam lattices, triply periodic surfaces and ordered dithering have widely been studied for their mechanical properties.
Several review papers provide a comprehensive overview of \revise{such microstructures.}{lattices, which are also known as `microstructures', `meso-scale structures', `cellular materials', etc.}\cite{Cadman2013,Zhang2018a,tamburrino2018}
Single material \revise{microstructure}{lattice}s can constitute auxetic materials, % TODO citation needed
or light weight structures with tailored material properties, through fine adjustments of the \revise{microstructure}{lattice} geometry. % TODO citation needed
%Such \revise{microstructure}{lattice}s are often manufactured using stereolithography and polyjetting, because these processes have very few manufacturing constraints.
Multi-material \revise{microstructure}{lattice}s inherently exhibit topological interlocking, which makes them good candidates for interlocking\cite{freund2019determination}.
However, optimizing \revise{microstructure}{lattice}s for adhesion\revise{s}{} between incompatible materials while adhering to \revise{FDM}{MEX} manufacturing constraints has been studied scarcely.

\paragraph{Adhesion}

Important factors for adhesion between polymers are entanglement and dissipation\cite{abbott2015adhesion}.
\revise{}{The adhesion between layers produced within a body of a single material produced by MEX can be influenced by various process parameters\cite{XiaGaoShunxinQiXiaoKuangYunlanSuJingLi1994,costa2019study},
as well as the geometry of the toolpaths\cite{Duty2019,Kazmer2020,debora2020};
of specific relevance to this paper is a technique of weaving printed lines across layers\cite{yao20213d}.}
The adhesion by which two bodies of different \revise{FDM}{MEX} printed material\revise{}{s} stick together can be influences by a wide spectrum of pre-treatment methods, process parameters and material properties\cite{freund2019determination,lopes2018multi}.
Increasing surface roughness might improve the adhesion between materials\cite{huttenbach1991interface,gent1990model}, but this supposed benefit is contested\cite{abbott2015adhesion}.
For \revise{FDM}{MEX} one could try mixing the materials by overlapping their toolpaths to increase adhesion or create simple straight protrusions in order to increase the friction between the two materials\cite{tamburrino19}.
However, if such protrusions bulge outward the adhesion does not merely increase because of the increased friction, but also because it would constitute a dovetail type of interlocking structure.

% Cura 4.8 allows for generating sandwich structures where the layers are alternated between the two materials.


\paragraph{Interlocking in \revise{FDM}{MEX}}

%\subsubsection{Dovetail interlocking}
Literature on interlocking patterns for adhesion between incompatible materials in \revise{FDM}{MEX} 3D printing has focussed on extruded 2D interlocking dovetail type of designs,
such as jigsaw shapes \cite{malik2017}, trapezoidal sutures \cite{Li2013}, T-shapes\cite{Ribeiro2019,mustafa2021development} and star shapes\cite{Wang2021} in the horizontal direction
as well as in the vertical direction across several layers\cite{debora2020}.
Topology optimization can generate complex 2D dovetail interlocking shapes, which fit to the specifics of the design locally\cite{aharoni2021}.
\revise{Such}{In as much as such} interlocking designs are \revise{}{straight }extrusions of 2D shapes \revise{and therefore }{}they allow for translation along the extrusion axis, so these type of interlocking designs do not lock all axes.\footnote{\revise{}{The addition of a layer of material on top and below the extrusions is a simple ad hoc method to lock the translation, but such an addition is not an inherent element of such lattices.}}

The jigsaw idea can be expanded into a 3D interlocking structure by protruding not only sideways, but also vertically, resulting in a shape resembling a tree\cite{gouker2006manufacturing}.
Similarly the T-shaped interlocking design with horizontal bars could be expanded with bars in the vertical directions.
However, such designs violate the semi-continuous extrusion requirement because the layers above and below the base of the T would contain separated islands of one material, 
which are difficult to print accurately when the two materials do not adhere to each other.

%\subsubsection{Topological interlocking}
These issues can be addressed by generating a repeating \revise{microstructure}{lattice} where the interlocks are connected together;
simple straight I shaped extrusions can be linked together by cross beams in order to form a topologically interlocking structure resembling a ladder\cite{Rossing2020}.
Such a topologically interlocking structure satisfies the continuity constraint only for a single material and is therefore interesting for applications where the one material is 3D printed, while the other is overmolded silicone.
However, a different \revise{microstructure}{lattice} is required if the extrusion continuity constraint is to be met by both materials.

%%  Single material adhesion structures
%The mechanical properties of single material 3D prints can also be improved by techniques similar to interlocking.
%By injecting material which span several layers the inter-layer bonding can be improved\cite{Duty2019,Kazmer2020}.
%Weaving extruded strands together across several layers is another technique to improve layer adhesion\cite{yao20213d}.

\subsection{Contributions}
\revise{}{
We propose an interlocking lattice consisting of interlaced horizontal beams which satisfy the extrusion continuity constraint.
The lattice interlocks all degrees of freedom in 3D space and as such lends itself to interfaces between the bodies of different material of arbitrary orientation.
We consider the situation of a horizontally applied tensile force to bodies with a vertical interface,
and optimize the lattice in two different orientations w.r.t. the interface using a simple analytical model.
The optimized structures are validated using numerical simulation as well as physical experiments.
Results show that the ITIL lattice on a vertical interface performs comparably to dovetail type interlocking geometries.
