\section{Conclusion}

interlocking can achieve 85\% of the strength of the PP and TPLA base materials; we reach about 65\%

diagonal design outperforms dovetail interlocking?

genus interlocking shows potential for high compliance materials

genus interlocking can help with complex and slanted surfaces 


\subsection{Applications}
exxplain: PP for living hinges; TPLA for stiffness

\subsection{Future work}
optimize for different loadings, different materials, different nozzle sizes

optimize for complex surfaces and complex loading situations
