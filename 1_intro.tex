\section{Introduction}

Intuitively it seems impossible to generate high genus interlocking geometry while enforcing continuous extrusion for both materials;
if the one material leaves a hole in a layer then filling that hole with the other material will cause it to be disconnected from the other regions of the second material.



Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A high genus interlocking structure for continuous extrusion
	\item A similar structure optimized for bending
	\item A similar structure optimized for tensile pulling
\end{itemize}
